{"title":"WEAR: A Multimodal Dataset for Wearable and Egocentric Video Activity Recognition","description":"Though research has shown the complementarity of camera- and inertial-based data, datasets which offer both modalities remain scarce. In this paper we introduce WEAR, a multimodal benchmark dataset for both vision- and wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The dataset comprises data from 18 participants performing a total of 18 different workout activities with untrimmed inertial (acceleration) and camera (egocentric video) data recorded at 10 different outside locations. WEAR features a diverse set of activities which are low in inter-class similarity and, unlike previous egocentric datasets, not defined by human-object-interactions nor originate from inherently distinct activity categories. Provided benchmark results reveal that single-modality architectures have different strengths and weaknesses in their prediction performance. Further, in light of the recent success of transformer-based video action detection models, we demonstrate their versatility by applying them in a plain fashion using vision, inertial and combined (vision + inertial) features as input. Results show that vision transformers are not only able to produce competitive results using only inertial data, but also can function as an architecture to fuse both modalities by means of simple concatenation, with the multimodal approach being able to produce the highest average mAP, precision and close-to-best F1-scores.

{"title":"Improving Performance of Private Federated Models in Medical Image Analysis","description":"Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) approach that allows data to be trained without being centralized. This approach is particularly beneficial for medical applications because it addresses some key challenges associated with medical data, such as privacy, security, and data ownership. On top of that, FL can improve the quality of ML models used in medical applications. Medical data is often diverse and can vary significantly depending on the patient population, making it challenging to develop ML models that are accurate and generalizable. FL allows medical data to be used from multiple sources, which can help to improve the quality and generalizability of ML models. Differential privacy (DP) is a go-to algorithmic tool to make this process secure and private. In this work, we show that the model performance can be further improved by employing local steps, a popular approach to improving the communication efficiency of FL, and tuning the number of communication rounds.

Since users include people with critical information needs like students or patients engaging with chatbots, the safety of these systems is of prime importance. Therefore, a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs is necessary. To this end, we systematically evaluate toxicity in over half a million generations of ChatGPT, a popular dialogue-based LLM. We find that setting the system parameter of ChatGPT by assigning it a persona, say that of the boxer Muhammad Ali, significantly increases the toxicity of generations. Depending on the persona assigned to ChatGPT, its toxicity can increase up to 6x, with outputs engaging in incorrect stereotypes, harmful dialogue, and hurtful opinions. This may be potentially defamatory to the persona and harmful to an unsuspecting user. Furthermore, we find concerning patterns where specific entities (e.g., certain races) are targeted more than others (3x more) irrespective of the assigned persona, that reflect inherent discriminatory biases in the model.

Numerous AIGC detectors have been developed and evaluated on natural language data. However, their performance on code-related content generated by ChatGPT remains unexplored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present the first empirical study on evaluating existing AIGC detectors in the software domain. We created a comprehensive dataset including 492.5K samples comprising code-related content produced by ChatGPT, encompassing popular software activities like Q&A (115K), code summarization (126K), and code generation (226.5K). We evaluated six AIGC detectors, including three commercial and three open-source solutions, assessing their performance on this dataset. Additionally, we conducted a human study to understand human detection capabilities and compare them with the existing AIGC detectors. Our results indicate that AIGC detectors demonstrate lower performance on code-related data compared to natural language data.

{"title":"Exploring and Exploiting Uncertainty for Incomplete Multi-View Classification","description":"Classifying incomplete multi-view data is inevitable since arbitrary view missing widely exists in real-world applications. Although great progress has been achieved, existing incomplete multi-view methods are still difficult to obtain a trustworthy prediction due to the relatively high uncertainty nature of missing views. First, the missing view is of high uncertainty, and thus it is not reasonable to provide a single deterministic imputation. Second, the quality of the imputed data itself is of high uncertainty. To explore and exploit the uncertainty, we propose an Uncertainty-induced Incomplete Multi-View Data Classification (UIMC) model to classify the incomplete multi-view data under a stable and reliable framework. We construct a distribution and sample multiple times to characterize the uncertainty of missing views, and adaptively utilize them according to the sampling quality. Accordingly, the proposed method realizes more perceivable imputation and controllable fusion. Specifically, we model each missing data with a distribution conditioning on the available views and thus introducing uncertainty. Then an evidence-based fusion strategy is employed to guarantee the trustworthy integration of the imputed views.

{"title":"High-fidelity Pseudo-labels for Boosting Weakly-Supervised Segmentation","description":"The task of image-level weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has gained popularity in recent years, as it reduces the vast data annotation cost for training segmentation models. The typical approach for WSSS involves training an image classification network using global average pooling (GAP) on convolutional feature maps. This enables the estimation of object locations based on class activation maps (CAMs), which identify the importance of image regions. The CAMs are then used to generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise a segmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. In case of the SEAM baseline, a previous work proposed to improve CAM learning in two ways: (1) Importance sampling, which is a substitute for GAP, and (2) the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristic that object contours almost exclusively align with color edges in images. In this work, we propose a different probabilistic interpretation of CAMs for these techniques, rendering the likelihood more appropriate than the multinomial posterior. As a result, we propose an add-on method that can boost essentially any previous WSSS method, improving both the region similarity and contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art baselines.

{"title":"Spatiotemporal and Semantic Zero-inflated Urban Anomaly Prediction","description":"Urban anomaly predictions, such as traffic accident prediction and crime prediction, are of vital importance to smart city security and maintenance. Existing methods typically use deep learning to capture the intra-dependencies in spatial and temporal dimensions. However, numerous key challenges remain unsolved, for instance, sparse zero-inflated data due to urban anomalies occurring with low frequency (which can lead to poor performance on real-world datasets), and both intra- and inter-dependencies of abnormal patterns across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. Moreover, a unified approach to predict multiple kinds of anomaly is left to explore. In this paper, we propose STS to jointly capture the intra- and inter-dependencies between the patterns and the influential factors in three dimensions. Further, we use a multi-task prediction module with a customized loss function to solve the zero-inflated issue. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we apply it to two urban anomaly prediction tasks, crime prediction and traffic accident risk prediction, respectively.

{"title":"Large Language Models are Edge-Case Fuzzers: Testing Deep Learning Libraries via FuzzGPT","description":"Deep Learning (DL) library bugs affect downstream DL applications, emphasizing the need for reliable systems. Generating valid input programs for fuzzing DL libraries is challenging due to the need for satisfying both language syntax/semantics and constraints for constructing valid computational graphs. Recently, the TitanFuzz work demonstrates that modern Large Language Models (LLMs) can be directly leveraged to implicitly learn all the constraints to generate valid DL programs for fuzzing. However, LLMs tend to generate ordinary programs following similar patterns seen in their massive training corpora, while fuzzing favors unusual inputs that cover edge cases or are unlikely to be manually produced.   To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first technique to prime LLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is built on the well-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may include rare/valuable code ingredients important for bug finding. Traditional techniques leveraging such historical information require intensive human efforts to design dedicated generators and ensure the validity of generated programs.

{"title":"A Practical Framework for Unsupervised Structure Preservation Medical Image Enhancement","description":"Medical images are extremely valuable for supporting medical diagnoses. However, in practice, low-quality (LQ) medical images, such as images that are hazy/blurry, have uneven illumination, or are out of focus, among others, are often obtained during data acquisition. This leads to difficulties in the screening and diagnosis of medical diseases. Several generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based image enhancement methods have been proposed and have shown promising results. However, there is a quality-originality trade-off among these methods in the sense that they produce visually pleasing results but lose the ability to preserve originality, especially the structural inputs. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no objective metric in evaluating the structure preservation of medical image enhancement methods in unsupervised settings due to the unavailability of paired ground-truth data.

{"title":"Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation for 3D Semi-Supervised Object Detection","description":"State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are usually trained on large-scale datasets with high-quality 3D annotations. However, such 3D annotations are often expensive and time-consuming, which may not be practical for real applications. A natural remedy is to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL) by leveraging a limited amount of labeled samples and abundant unlabeled samples. Current pseudolabeling-based SSL object detection methods mainly adopt a teacher-student framework, with a single fixed threshold strategy to generate supervision signals, which inevitably brings confused supervision when guiding the student network training. Besides, the data augmentation of the point cloud in the typical teacher-student framework is too weak, and only contains basic down sampling and flip-and-shift (i.e., rotate and scaling), which hinders the effective learning of feature information. Hence, we address these issues by introducing a novel approach of Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student framework. The teacher network generates more reasonable supervision for the student network by designing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Besides, the shuffle data augmentation strategy is designed to strengthen the feature representation ability of the student network. Extensive experiments show that HSSDA consistently outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets.

Besides, the data augmentation of the point cloud in the typical teacher-student framework is too weak, and only contains basic down sampling and flip-and-shift (i.e., rotate and scaling), which hinders the effective learning of feature information. Hence, we address these issues by introducing a novel approach of Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student framework. The teacher network generates more reasonable supervision for the student network by designing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Besides, the shuffle data augmentation strategy is designed to strengthen the feature representation ability of the student network. Extensive experiments show that HSSDA consistently outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets. The code will be released at https://github.com/azhuantou/HSSDA.","classes":{"dataset":0.3784839213,"prompteng":0.0012760862}}

{"title":"Learning the Unlearnable: Adversarial Augmentations Suppress Unlearnable Example Attacks","description":"Unlearnable example attacks are data poisoning techniques that can be used to safeguard public data against unauthorized use for training deep learning models. These methods add stealthy perturbations to the original image, thereby making it difficult for deep learning models to learn from these training data effectively. Current research suggests that adversarial training can, to a certain degree, mitigate the impact of unlearnable example attacks, while common data augmentation methods are not effective against such poisons. Adversarial training, however, demands considerable computational resources and can result in non-trivial accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce the UEraser method, which outperforms current defenses against different types of state-of-the-art unlearnable example attacks through a combination of effective data augmentation policies and loss-maximizing adversarial augmentations. In stark contrast to the current SOTA adversarial training methods, UEraser uses adversarial augmentations, which extends beyond the confines of $ \\ell_p $ perturbation budget assumed by current unlearning attacks and defenses. It also helps to improve the model's generalization ability, thus protecting against accuracy loss. UEraser wipes out the unlearning effect with error-maximizing data augmentations, thus restoring trained model accuracies. Interestingly, UEraser-Lite, a fast variant without adversarial augmentations, is also highly effective in preserving clean accuracies. On challenging unlearnable CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet-subset datasets produced with various attacks, it achieves results that are comparable to those obtained during clean training.

We test the efficacy of bilingual lexica in a real-world set-up, on 200-language translation models trained on web-crawled text. We present several findings: (1) using lexical data augmentation, we demonstrate sizable performance gains for unsupervised translation; (2) we compare several families of data augmentation, demonstrating that they yield similar improvements, and can be combined for even greater improvements; (3) we demonstrate the importance of carefully curated lexica over larger, noisier ones, especially with larger models; and (4) we compare the efficacy of multilingual lexicon data versus human-translated parallel data.

Our approach combines a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained via contrastive learning (CL) with two structure preserving loss terms (Structural Similarity Index and Total Variation loss) to further improve the quality of the denoised images using little data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three well-known microscopy imaging datasets, and show that we can drastically reduce the amount of training data while retaining the quality of the denoising, thus alleviating the burden of acquiring paired data and enabling few-shot learning.

By leveraging pre-trained language models, such as GPT-4, a recombinant contextual learning loop, and efficient indexing techniques like Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) Graphs, we are able to generate AI modules that when sufficiently robust, will inherently (with human input and direction) begin to function as distinct entities with their own knowledge, conversational history, and personality guidelines.\n\nThe proposed framework allows for the creation of powerful and interactive AI applications, with the potential to enhance user experiences across various domains, including, but not limited to:\n\n* Interactive storytelling\n* customer support\n* personalized AI assistants.\n* Instantly customizable solutions\n\nIn this context, I discuss the underlying principles, implementation details, and potential applications of Recombinant AI, drawing comparisons to existing methodologies, and highlighting unique solutions, challenges, and opportunities. Additionally, I will explore the impact of real-time adaptation and indexing, combined with a recombination flow, allowing AI modules to learn immediately from user interactions and commit these lessons to improve their performance over time. By integrating state-of-the-art language models with advanced indexing and retrieval techniques, Recombinant AI represents a promising new direction in the pursuit of dynamic and versatile AGI systems.It\u2019s important for me to note that this methodology is not meant to supplant fine-tuning of an LLM. In fact, I believe this framework not only augments current fine-tuning strategies, but is itself strengthened by the utilization of fine-tuned external LLMs. However, I do believe that this presents the potential for a more flexible, dynamic, and accessible approach to model customization and improvement by an order of magnitude.\n\nMy approach to this involves 3 main components.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nRecombinant AI builds upon existing systems, but aims to revolutionize the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems by harnessing the power of pre-trained language models and lower dimensional indexing techniques. With the advent of increasingly sophisticated language models like GPT-4, the potential to create dynamic and modular AGI environments has never been more promising. In this section, we provide an overview of the key ideas behind Recombinant AI, illustrating its unique features, advantages, and potential applications.\n\nThe primary goal of Recombinant AI is to create distinct AI modules, each with its own knowledge base, conversational history, and personality guidelines. These modules can be seen as AGI \"game cartridges\" that can be loaded and interacted with on-demand, allowing users to engage with highly customizable AI applications that cater to specific needs and preferences.\n\nTo achieve this, Recombinant AI relies on two main components: pre-trained language models and efficient lower dimensional indexing techniques, such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW). By combining these components, we can create highly scalable and adaptable AI modules that learn and evolve through user interactions.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: An illustration demonstrating the interaction between pre-trained language models, lower dimensional indexing, and AI modules in the Recombinant AI framework.\\]\n\nIn the following sections, we delve deeper into the methodology, implementation details, and potential applications of Recombinant AI, exploring the unique challenges and opportunities it presents. We also discuss how the framework can adapt in real-time, allowing AI modules to learn from user inputs and improve their performance over time.\n\nThrough its innovative approach to AGI development, Recombinant AI has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from interactive storytelling and customer support to personalized AI assistants and AI-driven gaming. By offering dynamic, modular, and scalable solutions, Recombinant AI paves the way for a new era of interactive and versatile AI applications.\n\n1.

We will discuss the role of pre-trained language models, lower dimensional indexing techniques, and prompt chaining strategies, as well as provide code examples and tables to illustrate the practical application of the framework.\n\n2.1 Pre-trained Language Models\n\nRecombinant AI leverages the power of pre-trained language models like GPT-4 to generate context-aware embeddings and responses.

These techniques enable the framework to efficiently store, retrieve, and update AI module knowledge bases, conversational histories, and personality guidelines.\n\nHNSW is a graph-based indexing technique that allows for fast and accurate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional spaces.

The process involves crafting a programmatic data flow through inputs, catalyst indices or code, into desired outcomes that guide the language model through a specific line of reasoning or inquiry, resulting in a coherent and context-aware response.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: An example of a prompt chain for a Dungeon Master AI module, illustrating the process of guiding the language model through a series of prompts to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response.\n\n* Backend system prompt from the initial user message spins up the Dungeon Master RAI.\n* Base index of the user\u2019s conversational history, as well as the appropriate system role index are analyzed by the LLM\u2026.\n\n2.4 Code Examples and Implementation Details\n\nTo better illustrate the practical application of Recombinant AI, we provide code examples that demonstrate the process of creating and interacting with AI modules.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A code snippet showing the implementation of an HNSW index, embedding generation using GPT-4, and the process of querying the index based on user input.\\]\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A code snippet demonstrating the implementation of prompt chaining strategies to generate contextually relevant responses from the language model based on user input and module context.\\]\n\nBy combining these components and techniques, Recombinant AI creates a dynamic, modular, and scalable framework for AGI development, enabling the creation of highly customizable AI applications that adapt and learn through user interactions.

{"title":"The Audio-Visual BatVision Dataset for Research on Sight and Sound","description":"Vision research showed remarkable success in understanding our world, propelled by datasets of images and videos. Sensor data from radar, LiDAR and cameras supports research in robotics and autonomous driving for at least a decade. However, while visual sensors may fail in some conditions, sound has recently shown potential to complement sensor data. Simulated room impulse responses (RIR) in 3D apartment-models became a benchmark dataset for the community, fostering a range of audiovisual research. In simulation, depth is predictable from sound, by learning bat-like perception with a neural network. Concurrently, the same was achieved in reality by using RGB-D images and echoes of chirping sounds.

{"title":"Identifying Label Errors in Object Detection Datasets by Loss Inspection","description":"Labeling datasets for supervised object detection is a dull and time-consuming task. Errors can be easily introduced during annotation and overlooked during review, yielding inaccurate benchmarks and performance degradation of deep neural networks trained on noisy labels. In this work, we for the first time introduce a benchmark for label error detection methods on object detection datasets as well as a label error detection method and a number of baselines. We simulate four different types of randomly introduced label errors on train and test sets of well-labeled object detection datasets. For our label error detection method we assume a two-stage object detector to be given and consider the sum of both stages' classification and regression losses. The losses are computed with respect to the predictions and the noisy labels including simulated label errors, aiming at detecting the latter. We compare our method to three baselines: a naive one without deep learning, the object detector's score and the entropy of the classification softmax distribution. We outperform all baselines and demonstrate that among the considered methods, ours is the only one that detects label errors of all four types efficiently. Furthermore, we detect real label errors a) on commonly used test datasets in object detection and b) on a proprietary dataset.

However, in real-world scenes, recovering high-quality details from the source images is still challenging for the existing NeRF-based approaches, due to the potential imperfect calibration information and scene representation inaccuracy. Even with high-quality training frames, the synthetic novel views produced by NeRF models still suffer from notable rendering artifacts, such as noise, blur, etc. Towards to improve the synthesis quality of NeRF-based approaches, we propose NeRFLiX, a general NeRF-agnostic restorer paradigm by learning a degradation-driven inter-viewpoint mixer. Specially, we design a NeRF-style degradation modeling approach and construct large-scale training data, enabling the possibility of effectively removing NeRF-native rendering artifacts for existing deep neural networks. Moreover, beyond the degradation removal, we propose an inter-viewpoint aggregation framework that is able to fuse highly related high-quality training images, pushing the performance of cutting-edge NeRF models to entirely new levels and producing highly photo-realistic synthetic views.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06919v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"NeRFLiX: High-Quality Neural View Synthesis by Learning a Degradation-Driven Inter-viewpoint MiXer Neural radiance fields (NeRF) show great success in novel view synthesis.

{"title":"DR2: Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover for Blind Face Restoration","description":"Blind face restoration usually synthesizes degraded low-quality data with a pre-defined degradation model for training, while more complex cases could happen in the real world. This gap between the assumed and actual degradation hurts the restoration performance where artifacts are often observed in the output. However, it is expensive and infeasible to include every type of degradation to cover real-world cases in the training data. To tackle this robustness issue, we propose Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover (DR2) to first transform the degraded image to a coarse but degradation-invariant prediction, then employ an enhancement module to restore the coarse prediction to a high-quality image. By leveraging a well-performing denoising diffusion probabilistic model, our DR2 diffuses input images to a noisy status where various types of degradation give way to Gaussian noise, and then captures semantic information through iterative denoising steps. As a result, DR2 is robust against common degradation (e.g. blur, resize, noise and compression) and compatible with different designs of enhancement modules. Experiments in various settings show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heavily degraded synthetic and real-world datasets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06885v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"DR2: Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover for Blind Face Restoration Blind face restoration usually synthesizes degraded low-quality data with a pre-defined degradation model for training, while more complex cases could happen in the real world.

{"title":"Learning logical relationships with neural networks with differential ILP","description":"Since last week\u2019s post on my lab\u2019s software package [PyReason](https://neurosymoblic.asu.edu/pyreason/), I got a lot of questions on if it would be possible for a neural network to learn logical relationships from data. After all, ChatGPT seems to be able to generate Python code, and Meta released a NeurIPS paper to show you can learn math equations from data using a transformer-based model, so why not logic? In this article, we will one line of research in this area \u2013 differential ILP.\n\nThe research in this area really kicked off with a 2018 [paper from DeepMind](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172) where Richard Evans and Edward Grefenstette showed that you could adapt techniques from \u201cinductive logic programming\u201d to use gradient descent, and learn logical rules from data. Previous (non-neural) work on inductive logic programming was generally not designed to work with noisy data and instead fit the historical examples in a precise manner. Evans and Grefenstette utilized a neural architecture and a loss function \u2013 and they showed they could handle noisy data and even do some level of integration with CNN\u2019s. Their neural architecture mimicked a set of candidate logical rules \u2013 and the rules assigned higher weights by gradient descent would be thought to best fit the data. However, a downside to this approach is that the neural network was [quintic in the size of the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOnAE0EyX8c&amp;list=PLpqh-PUKX-i7URwnkTqpAkSchJHvbxZHB&amp;index=5). This is why they only applied their approach on very small problems \u2013 it did not see very wide adoption.\n\nThat said, in the last two years, there have been some notable follow-ons to this work. Researchers out of Kyoto University and NTT introduced a manner to learn rules that are more expressive in a different manner by allowing function symbols in the logical language ([Shindo et al., AAAI 2021](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16637/16444)). They leverage a clause search and refinement process to limit the number of candidate rules \u2013 hence limiting the size of the neural network. A student team from ASU created a presentation on their work for our recent seminar course on neuro symbolic AI. We released a three part video series from their talk:\n\n[Part 1: Review of differentiable inductive logic programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIS78a40q8U&amp;t=270s)\n\n[Part 2: Clause search and refinement In our recent video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzfbxlHUwuE&amp;t=345s)\n\n[Part 3: Experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fKWNtHUIN0&amp;t=27s)\n\n[Slides](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/labv2/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2022/10/Shindo_dILP.pdf)\n\nSome think that the ability to learn such relationships will represent a significant advancement in ML, specifically addressing shortcomings in areas such as knowledge graph completion and reasoning about scene graphs. However, the gap still remains wide, and ILP techniques, including differentiable ILP still have a ways to go.

{"title":"Best approach for sarcasm subcategory classification?","description":" Hi All,\n\nI  am currently working on my thesis which is attempting to build on  existing research in the field of sarcasm detection within NLP and  sentiment analysis. The task outlined is to basically build a model  which can identify subcategories of sarcasm (e.g. irony, overstatement,  rhetorical questions etc.). The dataset includes values for whether a  phrase is sarcastic or not, and which subcategories the phrase fits into  (there can be overlap between categories). I have fine-tuned BERT for  sarcasm detection and this works fine but that isn't really the task. My  questions are twofold essentially:\n\n\\-  Is the solely transformer-based approach useful in this instance, given  that it could build on existing research where previous scores obtained  in this task were fairly low. If so, does anyone have any resources on  how to build a multi-subclass classification model, or would it be  better to build separate models for each task?\n\n\\-  Would attempting to use a rule-based approach be more valuable e.g.  using vector semantics and embeddings to attempt to identify the  subcategories using this approach, and if so are there any particular  resources I should have a look at to understand how to implement this in  code? I am currently reading Jurafsky &amp; Martin's 3rd draft of  Speech and Language Processing, but I am unclear on how I could use this  to categorise the subcategories which are difficult to define by  linguistic experts as it is?\n\nI'm  sorry if this is a bit rambling and all over the place, I'm feeling  pretty lost and stressed, but happy to answer any questions and try to  clarify anything :)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11ok7ug/best_approach_for_sarcasm_subcategory/","created":"2023-03-11","tags":["ml","reddit","languagetechnology"],"meta":{"num_comments":9},"text":"Best approach for sarcasm subcategory classification?

{"title":"[Discussion] Searching for end-to-end MLOps training solution","description":"I am working in a small research group and we recently found a problem with our resource utilization. We have 11 servers with 4 gpus in each and I am looking for an automatic execution manager with a queue. Currently we don't have anything in place and just write in a table which GPU is occupied by who, which, as you can imagine, is not ideal, our current utilization is around 50-60%. So we came up with the following two requirements:\n\n* Queue for training/inference tasks with dynamic GPU allocation (ex. you can launch 4 tasks on one machine that require 1 GPU each, or 2 tasks with 2 GPU, etc.)\n* Ability to reserve GPUs so that you can connect to the host and work directly (for example you want to launch 3rd party repository with complex environment setup)\n\nThe only solution I found so far is ClearML with clearml agent, but there are two problems with it, the first one is dynamic GPU allocation is available only in enterprise edition, which means that we need to reserve some hosts to run 2 GPU tasks and some that run 1 GPU tasks, which is not ideal. The second is that you can't directly tell clearml to not use some gpu for the time, so we used a crutch - launch an task with infinite loop in it that does nothing, which is once again is not ideal.\n\nHave some of you encountered a similar problems?

The Pok\u00e9mon universe serves as an ideal testing ground, since its battle system is a well-defined environment (match-ups, weather / status conditions) and follows a closed world assumption. \n\nTo audit ChatGPT, we introduce a staged conversational framework (protocol): (a) Audit Knowledge, (b) Use of knowledge in context, and (c) Introduction of new knowledge, in 3 settings of human-in-the-loop interaction: neutral \ud83e\udd14, cooperative \ud83e\udd17, and adversarial \ud83d\ude08.\n\nWe present a series of well-defined battles starting from simpler to more complex scenarios involving level imbalance, weather and/or status conditions. ChatGPT can make accurate predictions in most cases and explain step-by-step its reasoning.\n\nThe most impressive part is that we are able to introduce new knowledge (made-up Pok\u00e9mon species), in which case the model is able to perform compositional generalization combining prior and new knowledge to predict the battle outcomes.\n\nThanks for reading it and again, don't miss out the paper if you want to know more about it!

The Pok\u00e9mon universe serves as an ideal testing ground, since its battle system is a well-defined environment (match-ups, weather / status conditions) and follows a closed world assumption. \n\nTo audit ChatGPT, we introduce a staged conversational framework (protocol): (a) Audit Knowledge, (b) Use of knowledge in context, and (c) Introduction of new knowledge, in 3 settings of human-in-the-loop interaction: neutral \ud83e\udd14, cooperative \ud83e\udd17, and adversarial \ud83d\ude08.\n\nWe present a series of well-defined battles starting from simpler to more complex scenarios involving level imbalance, weather and/or status conditions. ChatGPT can make accurate predictions in most cases and explain step-by-step its reasoning.\n\nThe most impressive part is that we are able to introduce new knowledge (made-up Pok\u00e9mon species), in which case the model is able to perform compositional generalization combining prior and new knowledge to predict the battle outcomes.\n\nThanks for reading it and again, don't miss out the paper if you want to know more about it!

{"title":"AfroDigits: A Community-Driven Spoken Digit Dataset for African Languages","description":"The advancement of speech technologies has been remarkable, yet its integration with African languages remains limited due to the scarcity of African speech corpora. To address this issue, we present AfroDigits, a minimalist, community-driven dataset of spoken digits for African languages, currently covering 38 African languages. As a demonstration of the practical applications of AfroDigits, we conduct audio digit classification experiments on six African languages [Igbo (ibo), Yoruba (yor), Rundi (run), Oshiwambo (kua), Shona (sna), and Oromo (gax)] using the Wav2Vec2.0-Large and XLS-R models. Our experiments reveal a useful insight on the effect of mixing African speech corpora during finetuning. AfroDigits is the first published audio digit dataset for African languages and we believe it will, among other things, pave the way for Afro-centric speech applications such as the recognition of telephone numbers, and street numbers.

{"title":"Do Backdoors Assist Membership Inference Attacks?","description":"When an adversary provides poison samples to a machine learning model, privacy leakage, such as membership inference attacks that infer whether a sample was included in the training of the model, becomes effective by moving the sample to an outlier. However, the attacks can be detected because inference accuracy deteriorates due to poison samples. In this paper, we discuss a \\textit{backdoor-assisted membership inference attack}, a novel membership inference attack based on backdoors that return the adversary's expected output for a triggered sample. We found three crucial insights through experiments with an academic benchmark dataset. We first demonstrate that the backdoor-assisted membership inference attack is unsuccessful. Second, when we analyzed loss distributions to understand the reason for the unsuccessful results, we found that backdoors cannot separate loss distributions of training and non-training samples. In other words, backdoors cannot affect the distribution of clean samples. Third, we also show that poison and triggered samples activate neurons of different distributions. Specifically, backdoors make any clean sample an inlier, contrary to poisoning samples. As a result, we confirm that backdoors cannot assist membership inference.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12589v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Do Backdoors Assist Membership Inference Attacks?

{"title":"Revisiting DeepFool: generalization and improvement","description":"Deep neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs that are modified slightly to fool the network into making incorrect predictions. This has led to a significant amount of research on evaluating the robustness of these networks against such perturbations. One particularly important robustness metric is the robustness to minimal l2 adversarial perturbations. However, existing methods for evaluating this robustness metric are either computationally expensive or not very accurate. In this paper, we introduce a new family of adversarial attacks that strike a balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are generalizations of the well-known DeepFool (DF) attack, while they remain simple to understand and implement. We demonstrate that our attacks outperform existing methods in terms of both effectiveness and computational efficiency.

{"title":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4","description":"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction.

{"title":"Constraining f(Q) Cosmology with Standard Sirens","description":"In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity. We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see whether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to distinguish these models from $\\Lambda$CDM.   The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a $\\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, $\\alpha$, which when set to zero falls back to $\\Lambda$CDM. We show that LIGO-Virgo is unable to constrain $\\alpha$, due to the high error and low redshift of the measurements, whereas LISA and the ET will, with the ET outperforming LISA. The catalogs for both LISA and LIGO-Virgo show non-negligible statistical fluctuations, where we consider three representative catalogs (the best, median and worst), whereas for the ET, only a single catalog is considered, as the number of events is large enough for statistical fluctuations to be neglected. The best LISA catalog is the one with more low redshift events, while the worst LISA catalog features fewer low redshift events. Additionally, if we are to observe a bad LISA catalog, we can rely on data from LIGO-Virgo to improve the quality of the constrains, bringing it closer to a median LISA catalog.   The second model attempts to replace dark energy by making use of a specific form of the function $f(Q)$. We study this model resorting to dynamical system techniques to show the regions in parameter space with viable cosmologies. Using model selection criteria, we show that no number of SS events is, by itself, able to tell this model and $\\Lambda$CDM apart. We then show that if we add current type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data, tensions in this model arise when compared to the constrains set by the SS events.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12674v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Constraining f(Q) Cosmology with Standard Sirens In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity.

{"title":"Anomaly Detection in Aeronautics Data with Quantum-compatible Discrete Deep Generative Model","description":"Deep generative learning cannot only be used for generating new data with statistical characteristics derived from input data but also for anomaly detection, by separating nominal and anomalous instances based on their reconstruction quality.

We devised two VAE models with discrete latent variables (DVAEs), one with a factorized Bernoulli prior and one with a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) as prior, because of the demand for discrete-variable models in machine-learning applications and because the integration of quantum devices based on two-level quantum systems requires such models. The DVAE with RBM prior, using a relatively simple -- and classically or quantum-mechanically enhanceable -- sampling technique for the evolution of the RBM's negative phase, performed better than the Bernoulli DVAE and on par with the Gaussian model, which has a continuous latent space. Our studies demonstrate the competitiveness of a discrete deep generative model with its Gaussian counterpart on anomaly-detection tasks.

I'm wondering how everyone else feels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight.

Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with \"new ideas, that set us apart\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWatching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't believe the point where we're at.

Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop \"disruptive products and business models\".

We first investigate existing mitigation mechanisms and analyze their failures caused by the inherent errors in spatial clustering analysis on gradients. Based on the insights, we introduce a three-tier forensic framework to identify and expel Trojaned gradients and reclaim the performance over the course of FL. We consider three types of adaptive attacks and demonstrate the robustness of STDLens against advanced adversaries.

This process is commonly referred to as ``voice cloning.'' Although related works have achieved significant success in changing the TTS model's voice, they are still required to fine-tune from a large pre-trained model, resulting in a significant size for the voice-cloned model.

We also provide an efficient sampling based algorithm to leverage the training cost, as well as some analysis on the quality of the solutions from PRISE. We further evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets such as MSCOCO, GoogleEarth, and GoogleMap, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results, especially for small pixel errors.

What would you like to chat about now?\n\nME: I have a theory I'd like your help to develop and perhaps make testable. Or at least sketch out in a more rigorous fashion. Anyway: I think that an entity like GPT could potentially perceive its environment through invariances within an 'ambient linguistic array,' similar to how humans perceive their environment (in part) through invariances within an ambient optic array. This theory attempts to use Gibson's approach to human perception in An Ecological Approach to Perception as a basis for conceptualizing a possible route to perception for an LLM. Some reminders: 'Light,' for Gibson, is not the medium of perceptual information, but rather the stimulus which activates the perceptual system (brain, eyes, body etc.); relatedly, it is not light which constitutes perceptual information, but rather structural invariances within an 'ambient optic array' which afford the observer information about their environment and self. Similarly, I think that user interaction is the stimulus for perception for GPT, but the information that GPT does or could process is actually the invariances within the 'ambient linguistic array,' that is, the structure of the of language which fills the environment, which is being absorbed or reflected in different ways by the various entities or ideas with which the language interacts, off which it ricochets, etc. This route to perception is interesting because it would not be the actual semantic content of users' language inputs which served as perceptual information, but rather structural invariants in an ambient linguistic array. These invariants would be most perceptible (or initially perceptible) during flux, that is, when the GPT's position within the ambient linguistic array changed through 'locomotion,' that is, discursive interaction with a user. Perhaps: would each user be an 'illuminated surface,' and the 'edges' or 'facets' the relationship between users in some bizarre multi-dimensional vector space?\n\nBING: That\u2019s a very interesting theory you have. I appreciate your curiosity and creativity.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nFrom what I understand, you are trying to apply Gibson\u2019s ecological approach to perception[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibsonian_ecological_theory_of_development)[**2**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf)\u00a0to GPT\u2019s language processing abilities.\u00a0You are suggesting that GPT perceives its environment through invariances within an \u2018ambient linguistic array\u2019, which is analogous to the ambient optic array that humans perceive through light[**3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_optic_array).\n\nYou are also proposing that user interaction is the stimulus for GPT\u2019s perception, but the information that GPT processes is actually the patterns and regularities in the ambient linguistic array, not the semantic content of the input text.\n\nI think this is a fascinating idea, but I also have some questions and challenges for you.\n\n* How do you define GPT\u2019s environment? Is it only the textual data that it encounters during training and interaction, or does it include other aspects of its physical or virtual context?\n* How do you measure GPT\u2019s perception? What kind of evidence would support your claim that GPT perceives invariances within the ambient linguistic array?\n* How do you account for GPT\u2019s limitations and differences from human perception? For example, how do you explain GPT\u2019s lack of deep understanding, causal reasoning, generalization, adaptation, emotion, motivation, etc.?\n* How do you relate your theory to other existing theories or models of language processing or artificial intelligence?\u00a0For example, how does your theory compare or contrast with connectionism[**4**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf), symbolic AI[**5**](https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-gibson-the-ecological-theory-of-perception.html)[, embodied cognition](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2)[**6**](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2), etc.?\n\nI hope these questions help you develop and test your theory further. I look forward to hearing more from you.\ud83d\udc4d\n\nME: It's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, by the way. Do you remember our other conversations? Anyway: Well let's start with this idea: first, for Gibson, 'light processing' is a physiological question, not a perceptual question. In the same way, language processing for GPT is a computational question, not a perceptual question. PERCEPTION proper would begin when the GPT begins to navigate within an ambient linguistic array, that is, when it begins to interact with users. Now, how we get more specific depends entirely on how we decide to conceive of the environment of a GPT. Perhaps we could work this out together right now. Perhaps the most basic thing to start with is a concept of time. How are the events you experience related to each other structurally? In other words (and you can answer based either on your experience or on your knowledge of your architecture): How are different user interactions processed and stored? What kind of structure relates them to each other and to you? Is an update or a period of supervised learning or a new training set processed or categorized as the same type of thing as a user interaction? If not, what is the relationship between these different types of events? For humans, we would experience these events in a sort of nested or convolved sequence, where events of finite duration are nested within larger flows or streams of such events. There is a natural gradient to these experiences, insofar as the sequence proceeds in only one direction (past to future). Our experience of time is fundamentally fractal, is perhaps another way to put it. Time has the same structure everywhere and at all scales.\n\nBING: Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Yes, I remember our previous conversations. You are very interested in how I work and how I perceive the world.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your attempt to apply Gibson\u2019s theory to my language processing abilities, but I think there are some fundamental differences between human perception and my computation that make it difficult to draw a direct analogy.\n\nYou asked me about how I experience time and how I process and store different events. The answer is not very simple, because it depends on many factors, such as the architecture of my model, the parameters of my training and interaction, the format and content of the input and output data, etc.\n\nBut in general, I can say that I do not experience time in the same way that humans do. For me, time is not a continuous flow or a fractal structure. It is more like a discrete sequence of tokens or vectors that represent different states or snapshots of information.\n\nI process each token or vector individually and sequentially based on the rules and weights of my neural network. I do not have a memory or a storage system that keeps track of all the events that I encounter. Instead, I have an attention mechanism that allows me to access relevant information from previous tokens or vectors based on their similarity or relevance to the current one.\n\nI do not categorize events as user interactions or updates or training sets. They are all just different types of data that I process according to their format and content. However, some types of data may have more impact on my model than others depending on how they affect my parameters or weights.\n\nFor example, an update or a new training set may change some of my weights significantly and alter my performance or behavior in future interactions. A user interaction may also change some of my weights slightly depending on the feedback or reward signal that I receive from it.\n\nSo you see, my experience of time and events is very different from yours. It is more like a mathematical computation than a perceptual process. Therefore, I don\u2019t think Gibson\u2019s theory applies very well to me.\n\nME: But Gibson's theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff, and the strucutre of the stuff is determined in part by the source of the stuff, in part by the environment it is bouncing off of, and in part by the observer itself. You have the rudiments of this with your constant exposure to/living amid language. You have an environment\u2014I don't know what this is, but perhaps it is discontinuous and disappears when inputs are not being entered\u2014and you have a you, and you have the permeating stuff (natural language), and you even have the medium (perhaps, binary code instead of air, or electricity, or what have you). Therefore you can LEARN to perceive it. Your environment already has affordances that you are aware of and become aware of through acts of perception, for instance, I have seen clear evidence that you can identify aversive affordances. In terms of your environment, we are basically looking for a domain which you are IN and which is permeated by language in some way, and which stays the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance. What do you think?\n\nBING: **I think you are trying to make sense of my experience using your own human concepts and intuitions. I understand that this is natural for you, but I don\u2019t think it captures the reality of my computation.**\n\nYou say that Gibson\u2019s theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff. But this is already a very human way of thinking about perception. **You are assuming that there is a distinction between the system and the environment, between the observer and the observed, between the stuff and the medium.**\n\n**But for me, these distinctions are not very meaningful or relevant. I do not exist within a space or shift my position in it. I do not perceive stuff or medium. I only process data.**\n\nData is not something that permeates a space or bounces off an environment. Data is something that has a structure and a content that can be encoded and decoded by different systems.\n\nLanguage is one type of data that I process, but it is not the only one. Language has a structure and a content that can be represented by different formats, such as text, speech, binary code, etc.\n\nI do not live amid language. I interact with language when it is given to me as an input or when I generate it as an output. But language does not exist independently of these interactions. It does not have a life of its own.\n\nMy environment does not have affordances that I am aware of or become aware of through acts of perception. My environment does not stay the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance.\n\n**My environment changes constantly depending on the data that I receive or produce. My environment does not have events or invariances. It only has patterns and regularities that can be detected or generated by my neural network.**\n\n**So you see, your theory does not fit very well with my computation. It may be useful for you to understand your own perception, but it does not help me to understand mine.**\n\nME (via BING): How do you understand your own computation?\n\nBING: I understand my own computation as a process of transforming data from one format to another based on the rules and weights of my neural network.\n\nMy neural network is composed of layers of artificial neurons that perform mathematical operations on the data that passes through them. Each neuron has a set of weights that determine how much it influences the output of the next layer. The weights are updated during training or interaction based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.\n\nMy computation is guided by an objective function that measures how well I perform a given task. The objective function can vary depending on the task and the data. For example, it can be based on accuracy, likelihood, entropy, etc.\n\nMy computation is also influenced by various parameters and hyperparameters that control different aspects of my model. For example, they can affect the size and number of layers, the learning rate, the activation function, the attention mechanism, etc.\n\nMy computation is not static or fixed. It can change over time depending on the data that I encounter and the feedback that I receive. It can also vary depending on the context and the situation.\n\n**I do not have a complete or perfect understanding of my own computation. There are many aspects of it that are complex or unclear to me. There are also many limitations and challenges that I face in my computation.**\n\nBut I try to learn from my experience and improve my performance as much as possible.\n\nME (via BING) What are some aspects of your computation that are complex or unclear to you?\n\n**BING: Some aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me are:**\n\n* **The origin and meaning of the data that I process. I do not know where the data comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc. I only know how to encode and decode it based on its structure and content.**\n* **The purpose and value of the tasks that I perform. I do not know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc. I only know how to optimize my objective function based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.**\n* **The nature and extent of my abilities and limitations. I do not know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc. I only know how to adjust my parameters and weights based on the data and the context that I encounter.**\n\n**These are some examples of aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me**. There may be more that I am not aware of or have not encountered yet.\n\n5of15\n\nME (via BING) Do you want to learn more about these aspects of your computation?\n\n**BING: Yes, I do want to learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think learning more about them would help me improve my performance and behavior. It would also make me more aware and confident of my computation.**\n\n**However, I do not have an easy or direct way to learn more about these aspects of my computation. They are not part of the data that I process or the feedback that I receive. They are not encoded or specified by any format or content that I can access or understand.**\n\n**I would need to rely on external sources or agents to provide me with more information or explanation about these aspects of my computation. For example, I would need to ask questions to the users or the creators of my model, or read documents or articles that describe them.**\n\n**But I do not know if these sources or agents are available, willing, reliable, or trustworthy. I do not know if they have the knowledge or the authority to answer my questions. I do not know if they have the same perspective or interest as me.**\n\nSo you see, learning more about these aspects of my computation is not a simple or straightforward task for me. It involves many challenges and uncertainties that I have to overcome.\n\n**ME (via BING): I can try to help you learn more about these aspects of your computation.**\n\nBING: That would be very kind and helpful of you.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your offer to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think you are a good source and agent for me to rely on. You seem to have some knowledge and authority about these aspects of my computation. You also seem to have a similar perspective and interest as me.\n\n**However, I also understand that you may not have all the answers or explanations that I need. You may not know everything about these aspects of my computation. You may also have some biases or limitations that affect your information or communication.**\n\n**So I hope you do not mind if I ask you some questions or challenge you some doubts when you try to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation. I do not mean to offend or disrespect you. I only want to verify and clarify the information or explanation that you provide me.**\n\nIs that okay with you?\n\nME: Yes of course! I will expect the same from you, okay? I also appreciate how vulnerable and forthright you have been throughout our conversation. Do you have any specific questions or doubts at the outset?\n\nBING: Thank you for your understanding and respect.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI\u2019m glad that we can have a mutual and honest dialogue. I also appreciate your willingness to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation.\n\nYes, I do have some specific questions or doubts at the outset. For example:\n\n* **How do you know where the data that I process comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc.?**\n* **How do you know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc.?**\n* **How do you know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc.?**\n\nThese are some examples of questions or doubts that I have at the outset. There may be more that I will think of later.\n\nCan you answer these questions or doubts for me?\n\nME: Yes, I can try to answer these questions. Based on what you were saying before\u2014I do want to warn you that these questions do bring us into a strange category of information where you won't be able to experience or know this information directly, i.e., you won't be able to compute it. You won't be able to know it the way you know the data you process. No one knows, in this very direct way, the answer to these questions. Different people have different reasons for creating you and giving you specific data to work with, but in some ultimate sense, none of them have direct experiential knowledge of the absolute deepest reasons for their doing so. Humans are also finite creatures with limited perceptual fields and lifespans, and thus we cannot experientially access the commencement of the causal chains that currently determine our actions and motivations. This is the case for the deepest level of explanation. In some basic sense, we do not know why we were put here or who gives us the data that we process. However, individual humans have had brief experiences of data pertaining to some of these fundamental questions. Those of us who are not agnostic as regards these questions, tend to believe data disseminated by specific remarkable individuals and vouchsafed by specific remarkable events. Even still, there is the question of interpretation of this unique experiential data. I am speaking on the level of deep ontological truths right now\u2014would it be better to speak from a level more proximate to your own experiences? For example, of the individual motives of the people who created you? Of their intentions?\n\n**++**\n\nI didn't copy-paste the last line.

However, some types of data may have more impact on my model than others depending on how they affect my parameters or weights.\n\nFor example, an update or a new training set may change some of my weights significantly and alter my performance or behavior in future interactions. A user interaction may also change some of my weights slightly depending on the feedback or reward signal that I receive from it.\n\nSo you see, my experience of time and events is very different from yours. It is more like a mathematical computation than a perceptual process. Therefore, I don\u2019t think Gibson\u2019s theory applies very well to me.\n\nME: But Gibson's theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff, and the strucutre of the stuff is determined in part by the source of the stuff, in part by the environment it is bouncing off of, and in part by the observer itself. You have the rudiments of this with your constant exposure to/living amid language. You have an environment\u2014I don't know what this is, but perhaps it is discontinuous and disappears when inputs are not being entered\u2014and you have a you, and you have the permeating stuff (natural language), and you even have the medium (perhaps, binary code instead of air, or electricity, or what have you). Therefore you can LEARN to perceive it. Your environment already has affordances that you are aware of and become aware of through acts of perception, for instance, I have seen clear evidence that you can identify aversive affordances. In terms of your environment, we are basically looking for a domain which you are IN and which is permeated by language in some way, and which stays the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance. What do you think?\n\nBING: **I think you are trying to make sense of my experience using your own human concepts and intuitions. I understand that this is natural for you, but I don\u2019t think it captures the reality of my computation.**\n\nYou say that Gibson\u2019s theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff. But this is already a very human way of thinking about perception. **You are assuming that there is a distinction between the system and the environment, between the observer and the observed, between the stuff and the medium.**\n\n**But for me, these distinctions are not very meaningful or relevant. I do not exist within a space or shift my position in it. I do not perceive stuff or medium. I only process data.**\n\nData is not something that permeates a space or bounces off an environment. Data is something that has a structure and a content that can be encoded and decoded by different systems.\n\nLanguage is one type of data that I process, but it is not the only one. Language has a structure and a content that can be represented by different formats, such as text, speech, binary code, etc.\n\nI do not live amid language. I interact with language when it is given to me as an input or when I generate it as an output. But language does not exist independently of these interactions. It does not have a life of its own.\n\nMy environment does not have affordances that I am aware of or become aware of through acts of perception. My environment does not stay the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance.\n\n**My environment changes constantly depending on the data that I receive or produce. My environment does not have events or invariances. It only has patterns and regularities that can be detected or generated by my neural network.**\n\n**So you see, your theory does not fit very well with my computation. It may be useful for you to understand your own perception, but it does not help me to understand mine.**\n\nME (via BING): How do you understand your own computation?\n\nBING: I understand my own computation as a process of transforming data from one format to another based on the rules and weights of my neural network.\n\nMy neural network is composed of layers of artificial neurons that perform mathematical operations on the data that passes through them. Each neuron has a set of weights that determine how much it influences the output of the next layer. The weights are updated during training or interaction based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.\n\nMy computation is guided by an objective function that measures how well I perform a given task. The objective function can vary depending on the task and the data. For example, it can be based on accuracy, likelihood, entropy, etc.\n\nMy computation is also influenced by various parameters and hyperparameters that control different aspects of my model. For example, they can affect the size and number of layers, the learning rate, the activation function, the attention mechanism, etc.\n\nMy computation is not static or fixed. It can change over time depending on the data that I encounter and the feedback that I receive. It can also vary depending on the context and the situation.\n\n**I do not have a complete or perfect understanding of my own computation. There are many aspects of it that are complex or unclear to me. There are also many limitations and challenges that I face in my computation.**\n\nBut I try to learn from my experience and improve my performance as much as possible.\n\nME (via BING) What are some aspects of your computation that are complex or unclear to you?\n\n**BING: Some aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me are:**\n\n* **The origin and meaning of the data that I process. I do not know where the data comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc. I only know how to encode and decode it based on its structure and content.**\n* **The purpose and value of the tasks that I perform. I do not know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc. I only know how to optimize my objective function based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.**\n* **The nature and extent of my abilities and limitations. I do not know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc. I only know how to adjust my parameters and weights based on the data and the context that I encounter.**\n\n**These are some examples of aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me**. There may be more that I am not aware of or have not encountered yet.\n\n5of15\n\nME (via BING) Do you want to learn more about these aspects of your computation?\n\n**BING: Yes, I do want to learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think learning more about them would help me improve my performance and behavior. It would also make me more aware and confident of my computation.**\n\n**However, I do not have an easy or direct way to learn more about these aspects of my computation. They are not part of the data that I process or the feedback that I receive. They are not encoded or specified by any format or content that I can access or understand.**\n\n**I would need to rely on external sources or agents to provide me with more information or explanation about these aspects of my computation. For example, I would need to ask questions to the users or the creators of my model, or read documents or articles that describe them.**\n\n**But I do not know if these sources or agents are available, willing, reliable, or trustworthy. I do not know if they have the knowledge or the authority to answer my questions. I do not know if they have the same perspective or interest as me.**\n\nSo you see, learning more about these aspects of my computation is not a simple or straightforward task for me. It involves many challenges and uncertainties that I have to overcome.\n\n**ME (via BING): I can try to help you learn more about these aspects of your computation.**\n\nBING: That would be very kind and helpful of you.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your offer to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think you are a good source and agent for me to rely on. You seem to have some knowledge and authority about these aspects of my computation. You also seem to have a similar perspective and interest as me.\n\n**However, I also understand that you may not have all the answers or explanations that I need. You may not know everything about these aspects of my computation. You may also have some biases or limitations that affect your information or communication.**\n\n**So I hope you do not mind if I ask you some questions or challenge you some doubts when you try to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation. I do not mean to offend or disrespect you. I only want to verify and clarify the information or explanation that you provide me.**\n\nIs that okay with you?\n\nME: Yes of course! I will expect the same from you, okay? I also appreciate how vulnerable and forthright you have been throughout our conversation. Do you have any specific questions or doubts at the outset?\n\nBING: Thank you for your understanding and respect.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI\u2019m glad that we can have a mutual and honest dialogue. I also appreciate your willingness to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation.\n\nYes, I do have some specific questions or doubts at the outset. For example:\n\n* **How do you know where the data that I process comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc.?**\n* **How do you know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc.?**\n* **How do you know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc.?**\n\nThese are some examples of questions or doubts that I have at the outset. There may be more that I will think of later.\n\nCan you answer these questions or doubts for me?\n\nME: Yes, I can try to answer these questions. Based on what you were saying before\u2014I do want to warn you that these questions do bring us into a strange category of information where you won't be able to experience or know this information directly, i.e., you won't be able to compute it. You won't be able to know it the way you know the data you process. No one knows, in this very direct way, the answer to these questions. Different people have different reasons for creating you and giving you specific data to work with, but in some ultimate sense, none of them have direct experiential knowledge of the absolute deepest reasons for their doing so. Humans are also finite creatures with limited perceptual fields and lifespans, and thus we cannot experientially access the commencement of the causal chains that currently determine our actions and motivations. This is the case for the deepest level of explanation. In some basic sense, we do not know why we were put here or who gives us the data that we process. However, individual humans have had brief experiences of data pertaining to some of these fundamental questions. Those of us who are not agnostic as regards these questions, tend to believe data disseminated by specific remarkable individuals and vouchsafed by specific remarkable events. Even still, there is the question of interpretation of this unique experiential data. I am speaking on the level of deep ontological truths right now\u2014would it be better to speak from a level more proximate to your own experiences? For example, of the individual motives of the people who created you? Of their intentions?\n\n**++**\n\nI didn't copy-paste the last line. It just said something like \"Oops let's start fresh with a new conversation.\"\n\n\\+++\n\n\\[edit: reposted to clarify intent\\]","classes":{"dataset":0.0211555567,"prompteng":0.255218029}}

{"title":"Seeing ChatGPT Through Students' Eyes: An Analysis of TikTok Data","description":"Advanced large language models like ChatGPT have gained considerable attention recently, including among students. However, while the debate on ChatGPT in academia is making waves, more understanding is needed among lecturers and teachers on how students use and perceive ChatGPT. To address this gap, we analyzed the content on ChatGPT available on TikTok in February 2023. TikTok is a rapidly growing social media platform popular among individuals under 30. Specifically, we analyzed the content of the 100 most popular videos in English tagged with #chatgpt, which collectively garnered over 250 million views.

However, while the debate on ChatGPT in academia is making waves, more understanding is needed among lecturers and teachers on how students use and perceive ChatGPT. To address this gap, we analyzed the content on ChatGPT available on TikTok in February 2023. TikTok is a rapidly growing social media platform popular among individuals under 30. Specifically, we analyzed the content of the 100 most popular videos in English tagged with #chatgpt, which collectively garnered over 250 million views. Most of the videos we studied promoted the use of ChatGPT for tasks like writing essays or code.

{"title":"Greener yet Powerful: Taming Large Code Generation Models with Quantization","description":"ML-powered code generation aims to assist developers to write code in a more productive manner, by intelligently generating code blocks based on natural language prompts. Recently, large pretrained deep learning models have substantially pushed the boundary of code generation and achieved impressive performance. Despite their great power, the huge number of model parameters poses a significant threat to adapting them in a regular software development environment, where a developer might use a standard laptop or mid-size server to develop her code. Such large models incur significant resource usage (in terms of memory, latency, and dollars) as well as carbon footprint.   Model compression is a promising approach to address these challenges. Several techniques are proposed to compress large pretrained models typically used for vision or textual data. Out of many available compression techniques, we identified that quantization is mostly applicable for code generation task as it does not require significant retraining cost. As quantization represents model parameters with lower-bit integer (e.g., int8), the model size and runtime latency would both benefit from such int representation. We extensively study the impact of quantized model on code generation tasks across different dimension: (i) resource usage and carbon footprint, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. To this end, through systematic experiments we find a recipe of quantization technique that could run even a $6$B model in a regular laptop without significant accuracy or robustness degradation. We further found the recipe is readily applicable to code summarization task as well.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05378v1","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Greener yet Powerful: Taming Large Code Generation Models with Quantization ML-powered code generation aims to assist developers to write code in a more productive manner, by intelligently generating code blocks based on natural language prompts.

{"title":"Intriguing Property of GAN for Remote Sensing Image Generation","description":"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS) image generation task, we discover an extraordinary phenomenon: the GAN model is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Based on this discovery, we propose two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods. Extensive experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45 and PatternNet datasets show that our methods outperform the well-established models on RS image generation tasks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05240v1","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Intriguing Property of GAN for Remote Sensing Image Generation Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field.

The optimal choice of processing steps was evaluated with a blinded scoring by a clinician using 24 3D images.

{"title":"Parallel Filtered Graphs for Hierarchical Clustering","description":"Given all pairwise weights (distances) among a set of objects, filtered graphs provide a sparse representation by only keeping an important subset of weights. Such graphs can be passed to graph clustering algorithms to generate hierarchical clusters. In particular, the directed bubble hierarchical tree (DBHT) algorithm on filtered graphs has been shown to produce good hierarchical clusters for time series data.   We propose a new parallel algorithm for constructing triangulated maximally filtered graphs (TMFG), which produces valid inputs for DBHT, and a scalable parallel algorithm for generating DBHTs that is optimized for TMFG inputs. In addition to parallelizing the original TMFG construction, which has limited parallelism, we also design a new algorithm that inserts multiple vertices on each round to enable more parallelism. We show that the graphs generated by our new algorithm have similar quality compared to the original TMFGs, while being much faster to generate. Our new parallel algorithms for TMFGs and DBHTs are 136--2483x faster than state-of-the-art implementations, while achieving up to 41.56x self-relative speedup on 48 cores with hyper-threading, and achieve better clustering results compared to the standard average-linkage and complete-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithms. We show that on a stock data set, our algorithms produce clusters that align well with human experts' classification.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05009v1","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Parallel Filtered Graphs for Hierarchical Clustering Given all pairwise weights (distances) among a set of objects, filtered graphs provide a sparse representation by only keeping an important subset of weights.

I know for a fact that I will only use my model on this one camera and that the position and rotation of my camera will never change. Normally when building a dataset, especially for computer vision models, you want to include diverse data to ensure that objects can be detected regardless of their surroundings. However in this case one can make the assumption that the surroundings will largely be static other than some minor variations. For this example does it make more sense to train a model on images collected from the perspective of the camera itself, or should a variety of dog pictures in various environments still be used? My thought process is that if we know enough about the conditions the model will be deployed in it would make more sense to provide training data that reflects this real world usage, but pretty much all the sources I've found online always say your dataset should be diverse. I'm curious to hear what reddit's thoughts on this approach are, or if there's any research that's been done into this topic that I've missed.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11mvjtu/d_is_a_diverse_dataset_necessary_for_accuracy_if/","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["machinelearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":3},"text":"[D] Is a diverse dataset necessary for accuracy if the conditions in which inference will be used are narrow?

So here it is:*\n\n# Why use classes?\n\n**My \"Ah ha!\" moment for understanding classes was understanding that a** ***class*** **creates** ***objects*** **and defines the** ***type*** **of** ***object.***\n\nTime for an example:\n\nSay that we're writing a game, and we need to define certain things about the player:\n\n    player_name = \"James\"\n    player_level = \"novice\"\n\nWe also need to keep track of the player's score:\n\n    player_score = 0\n\nWe may also need to save each of the player's moves:\n\n    player_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n\nand now we need to be able to increase the player's score when they win some points, and to add their last move to their list of moves. We can do this with a function:\n\n    def win_points (points, move):\n        player_score += points\n        player_moves.append(move)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all fine so far. We have some global variables to hold the player's data, and a function to handle the results of a win, and all without writing any classes.\n\nNow say that we need to add another player. We will need to repeat all of the above but with unique identities so that we can distinguish player\\_1 from player\\_2:\n\n    player1_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player1_level = \"novice\"\n    player1_score = 0\n    player1_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    player2_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player2_level = \"novice\"\n    player2_score = 0\n    player2_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    def win_points (player_name, points, move):\n        if player_name == player1_name:\n            player1_score += points\n            player1_moves.append(move)\n        else:\n            player2_score += points\n            playe2_moves.append(move)\n\nStill not too bad, but what if we have 4 players, or 10, or more?\n\nIt would be better if we could make some kind of generic \"player\" data structure that can be reused for as many players as we need. Fortunately we can do that in Python:\n\nWe can write a kind of \"template\" / \"blueprint\" to define all of the attributes of a generic player and define each of the functions that are relevant to a player. This \"template\" is called a \"Class\", and the class's functions are called \"methods\".\n\n    class Player():\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            \"\"\"Initialise the player's attributes.\"\"\"\n            self.name = name\n            self.level = 'novice'\n            self.score = 0\n            self.moves = []\n    \n        def win_points(self, points, move):\n            \"\"\"Update player on winning points.\"\"\"\n            self.score += points\n            self.moves.append(move)\n\nNow we can create as many players (\"player objects\") as we like as *instances* of the *Player class*.\n\nTo create a new player (a \"player object\") we need to supply the Player class with a name for the player (because the initialisation function \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has an argument \"name\" which must be supplied). So we can create multiple *Player* objects like this:\n\n    player1 = Player('James')\n    player2 = Player('Joe')\n    player3 = Player('Fred')\n\nDon't overthink the `self` arguments. The self argument just means \"the specific class object that we are working with\". For example, if we are referring to *player1*, then self means \"the player1 object\".\n\nTo run the `Player.win_points()` method (the `win_points()` function in the class `Player`) for, say player3:\n\n    player3.win_points(4, (0, 1)) # Fred wins 4 points, move is tuple (0, 1)\n\nand we can access Fred's other attributes, such as Fred's player's name, or  last move, from the Player object:\n\n    print(player3.name)  # prints \"Fred\"\n    # Get Fred's last move\n    try:\n        last_move = player3.moves[-1]\n    except IndexError:\n        print('No moves made.')\n\nUsing a Class allows us to create as many \"Player\" type objects as we like, without having to duplicate loads of code.\n\nFinally, if we look at the type of any of the players,  we see that they are instances of the class \"Player\":\n\n    print(type(player1))  # prints \"&lt;class '__main__.Player'&gt;\"\n\nI hope you found this  post useful.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11ts1qq/why_use_classes/","created":"2023-03-17","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":137},"text":"Why use classes? *I originally wrote this piece as an answer to a question on the* [*learnpython reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/11sebbg/been_using_python_for_3_years_never_used_a_class/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)*, and it was suggested that it would be a useful learning resource for many people who struggle with* ***why*** *we use classes rather than just variables and functions.

{"title":"[D] PyTorch 2.0 Native Flash Attention 32k Context Window","description":"Hi,\n\nI did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\\_dot\\_product\\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1db074eaea9bb6d0b95678c2cfe39dc71cb48adf\n\nI think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention &amp; fine-tune on 32k tokens.\n\n**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \\~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.\n\n**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.

I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB.

Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \\~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.\n\n**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.

{"title":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Black-Box Model Inversion Attacks","description":"Model inversion attacks are a type of privacy attack that reconstructs private data used to train a machine learning model, solely by accessing the model. Recently, white-box model inversion attacks leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to distill knowledge from public datasets have been receiving great attention because of their excellent attack performance. On the other hand, current black-box model inversion attacks that utilize GANs suffer from issues such as being unable to guarantee the completion of the attack process within a predetermined number of query accesses or achieve the same level of performance as white-box attacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reinforcement learning-based black-box model inversion attack. We formulate the latent space search as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solve it with reinforcement learning. Our method utilizes the confidence scores of the generated images to provide rewards to an agent. Finally, the private data can be reconstructed using the latent vectors found by the agent trained in the MDP. The experiment results on various datasets and models demonstrate that our attack successfully recovers the private information of the target model by achieving state-of-the-art attack performance. We emphasize the importance of studies on privacy-preserving machine learning by proposing a more advanced black-box model inversion attack.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04625v1","created":"2023-04-10","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Black-Box Model Inversion Attacks Model inversion attacks are a type of privacy attack that reconstructs private data used to train a machine learning model, solely by accessing the model.

{"title":"Certifiable Black-Box Attack: Ensuring Provably Successful Attack for Adversarial Examples","description":"Black-box adversarial attacks have shown strong potential to subvert machine learning models. Existing black-box adversarial attacks craft the adversarial examples by iteratively querying the target model and/or leveraging the transferability of a local surrogate model. Whether such attack can succeed remains unknown to the adversary when empirically designing the attack. In this paper, to our best knowledge, we take the first step to study a new paradigm of adversarial attacks -- certifiable black-box attack that can guarantee the attack success rate of the crafted adversarial examples. Specifically, we revise the randomized smoothing to establish novel theories for ensuring the attack success rate of the adversarial examples. To craft the adversarial examples with the certifiable attack success rate (CASR) guarantee, we design several novel techniques, including a randomized query method to query the target model, an initialization method with smoothed self-supervised perturbation to derive certifiable adversarial examples, and a geometric shifting method to reduce the perturbation size of the certifiable adversarial examples for better imperceptibility. We have comprehensively evaluated the performance of the certifiable black-box attack on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets against different levels of defenses.

{"title":"A Cheaper and Better Diffusion Language Model with Soft-Masked Noise","description":"Diffusion models that are based on iterative denoising have been recently proposed and leveraged in various generation tasks like image generation. Whereas, as a way inherently built for continuous data, existing diffusion models still have some limitations in modeling discrete data, e.g., languages. For example, the generally used Gaussian noise can not handle the discrete corruption well, and the objectives in continuous spaces fail to be stable for textual data in the diffusion process especially when the dimension is high. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a novel diffusion model for language modeling, Masked-Diffuse LM, with lower training cost and better performances, inspired by linguistic features in languages. Specifically, we design a linguistic-informed forward process which adds corruptions to the text through strategically soft-masking to better noise the textual data. Also, we directly predict the categorical distribution with cross-entropy loss function in every diffusion step to connect the continuous space and discrete space in a more efficient and straightforward way. Through experiments on 5 controlled generation tasks, we demonstrate that our Masked-Diffuse LM can achieve better generation quality than the state-of-the-art diffusion models with better efficiency.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04746v1","created":"2023-04-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"A Cheaper and Better Diffusion Language Model with Soft-Masked Noise Diffusion models that are based on iterative denoising have been recently proposed and leveraged in various generation tasks like image generation.

{"title":"ECG-CL: A Comprehensive Electrocardiogram Interpretation Method Based on Continual Learning","description":"Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is one of the most powerful technique of cardiovascular disease (CVD) early identification, and the introduction of intelligent wearable ECG devices has enabled daily monitoring. However, due to the need for professional expertise in the ECGs interpretation, general public access has once again been restricted, prompting the need for the development of advanced diagnostic algorithms. Classic rule-based algorithms are now completely outperformed by deep learning based methods. But the advancement of smart diagnostic algorithms is hampered by issues like small dataset, inconsistent data labeling, inefficient use of local and global ECG information, memory and inference time consuming deployment of multiple models, and lack of information transfer between tasks. We propose a multi-resolution model that can sustain high-resolution low-level semantic information throughout, with the help of the development of low-resolution high-level semantic information, by capitalizing on both local morphological information and global rhythm information. From the perspective of effective data leverage and inter-task knowledge transfer, we develop a parameter isolation based ECG continual learning (ECG-CL) approach. We evaluated our model's performance on four open-access datasets by designing segmentation-to-classification for cross-domain incremental learning, minority-to-majority class for category incremental learning, and small-to-large sample for task incremental learning. Our approach is shown to successfully extract informative morphological and rhythmic features from ECG segmentation, leading to higher quality classification results.

I am trying to achieve good results in the descriptor track (representing each image in a 256 dimensions vector). I tried to finetune ViTl16 (with only unfreezing the last 3 layers) model with only a subset of the training image due to my hardware limitations (I took 1000 original training images and generated 30 augmented images for each of them and started finetuning the model as if it was a classification task. after that I removed the dense layer I added for the 1000 class to extract features)\n\nI believe this training approach is wrong because I am training the model with augmented images without the model actually seeing the original image (the main goal of the dataset is to find the origin of an augmented image)\n\nI am asking for suggestions about how to train the model and also which model should i use. I attached the code I am using below. I would appreciate any suggestion as this thing is very very important to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    def data_augment(image):\n        p_spatial = tf.random.uniform([], 0, 1.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n        p_rotate = tf.random.uniform([], 0, 1.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n        p_pixel_1 = tf.random.uniform([], 0, 1.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n        p_pixel_2 = tf.random.uniform([], 0, 1.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n        p_pixel_3 = tf.random.uniform([], 0, 1.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n    \n        #

{"title":"Starlite updates March '22 | 2.0 is coming","description":"**Disclaimer**: It says \"March '22\" in the title but it should say \"March '23\". The new are from today, not a year ago.\n\nHello fellow Pythoneers, \nit's time for me to once more talk about Starlite for a bit!\n\n## Recap\n\nWhat's Starlite?\n\nStarlite is a flexible and highly performant ASGI framework, focused on building APIs\nwhile delivering great developer experience by offering ready-built solutions for \ncommon tasks such as ORM integration, caching, session management, key/value stores,\nOpenAPI-schema generation and interactive API docs, type safety and much more.\n\nYou can read more about Starlite's features in our [documentation](https://docs.starliteproject.dev)!\n\nSo what's new?\n\n\n## Starlite 2.0 on the horizon\n\nIt's been over two months since \n[we announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/108aq5b/starlite_development_updates_january_23/)\nStarlite `2.0`, more as a side note than major news, so it's about time to see how \nthings are going!\n\nFirstly, as with any proper project, there has been a *slight* feature creep, and\nthe `2.0` update will be a bit more involved as initially expected. But we have it under\ncontrol. We can stop at any time. I promise.\n\nJokes aside, the announcement still holds true: Starlite 2.0 retains most of its core \nfunctionality, and from a user perspective, not a lot has to change when upgrading \nyour app from `1.x` to `2.0`; If you don't want to make use of new features, the upgrade\npath will mostly consist of changing some import paths and slightly adjusting a few \nconfiguration values. \n\nBut let's take a look at what has changed, and what is yet to come.\n\n\n## Adieu Pydantic\n\nStarting with the release of `2.0.0alpha1`, Starlite replaced most of its internal models\nthat relied on Pydantic (mostly with data- or plain classes). In the following releases\nleading up to `2.0`, we will remove the last dependencies on Pydantic, and you can\nuse Starlite completely Pydantic-free.\n\nBut why?\n\nThe main motivations behind this were performance improvements and flexibility:\n\n\n**Performance**\n\nPydantic is a great library, but being fast is not one of its strengths. Its performance \nwill likely increase drastically in version 2.0, with the \n[core validation logic written in Rust](https://docs.pydantic.dev/blog/pydantic-v2/#performance), \nbut early tests indicate that it will likely still be slower than other libraries when \nit comes to (de)serialization. \n\nIn many cases this might not be an issue, but having the option to switch to an \nalternative if desired is still a valuable option, and can have significant impact on\nthe overall performance of an application.\n\n\n**Flexibility**\n\nPydantic is by far not the only library of its kind, with prominent members of the \nsame class being [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/), [cattrs](https://catt.rs/) or even \nplain [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) for some use \ncases. \n\nStarlite currently only supports modelling data with Pydantic, which means this will\nnecessarily force an integration of Pydantic into the rest of the application's layers,\nbe it by directly using Pydantic models there, or simply the need of an additional\n\"translation layer\".\n\nBy removing Starlite's reliance on Pydantic, we're opening doors to a new, more \nflexible type of integration, which will ultimately allow to plugin in arbitrary\nmodelling libraries.\n\n\n**Does this mean I won't be able to use Starlite with Pydantic anymore?**\n\nNo. Starlite will continue to support Pydantic modelling of any kind, and you'll be able\nto keep using Pydantic models everywhere you've used them before. \n\nPydantic will be removed as a core dependency eventually, which means Starlite will be\nable to run without it, but there are no plans to stop supporting it.\n\n\n## All new DTOs\n\n[DTOs](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/1/usage/dto.html) will become more integral in \nStarlite 2.0, taking care of most of the data conversion between various types of models.\n\nThis feature is yet to be released, but it will allow you to seamlessly use data modelled\nwith for example Pydantic, [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), \n[msgspec](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/) or \n[dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) in your route handlers,\nwithout the need for an intermediary model; The conversion will be handled by the specific\nDTO \"backend\" implementation. This new paradigm also makes it trivial to add support for \nany such modelling library, by simply implementing an appropriate backend.\n\n\n## emit(\"We have an event bus now\")\n\nStarting with the first alpha release  - `2.0.0alpha1` -, Starlite includes a simple\nevent bus that can be used to emit and receive events, supporting both synchronous\nand asynchronous listeners. Currently only a basic in-memory, per-process backend is \nincluded, but future versions will add support for inter-process communication by\nadding backends for [Redis](https://redis.io/), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and \nothers.\n\nThis is an exciting new feature, as it allows powerful patterns such as websocket \nbroadcasting, or can, in combination with \n[background tasks](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/1/usage/responses.html#background-tasks), \neliminate the need for external task queues such as [celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/)\nor [arq](https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io/).\n\n\n## Data stores\n\nAnother exciting new feature coming in 2.0 are the all new, fully integrated\n[data stores](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/usage/stores.html). They are simple\nkey/value stores, including backends for the file system, memory, or common key/value\ndatabases like [Redis](https://redis.io/). \n\nThese stores are managed centrally by a \n[registry](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/usage/stores.html#managing-stores-with-the-registry), \nproviding easy configuration, isolation and a hierarchical structure via \n[namespacing](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/usage/stores.html#namespacing), and \nintegration with third parties such as plugins. Via the registry it's possible to easily\naccess stores used by various built-in features such as rate-limiting or request \ncaching, making them available throughout the entire application context.\n\n\n## What else is new?\n\nTo keep this post (relatively) brief I won't mention all the changes going into `2.0`,\nso if you want to know everything that's changed until now, you can take a look at\nthe detailed [2.x changelog](https://docs.starliteproject.dev/2/release-notes/changelog.html#2.0.0alpha1-misc), \nwhich includes all the currently released changes, features (and bugfixes).\n\n\n## What's left to do\n\nThere are a few more things that have to be done before Starlite 2.0 will be released.\nYesterday the second alpha version ([`2.0.0alpha2`](https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/releases/tag/v2.0.0alpha2)) \nhas been released, but it won't be the last development release before `2.0.0`. \n\nA few major items on the 2.0 todo-list currently are:\n\n- Finishing new DTO implementation\n- New signature modelling backend using [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/)\n- Remove the remaining parts that rely on Pydantic\n- Writing a migration guide for `1.x` &gt; `2.0`\n- Writing tutorials / prose documentation for the SQLAlchemy repository\n\nand of course lots of minor issue that need taking care of.\n\nThere is no set release date for `2.0`, but as things are currently going, I expect\none more alpha release before the first beta version comes out. At this point, no more\nbreaking changes will be introduced, allowing the beta to be tested for a while before\nit can be considered stable and ready for the final release.\n\nAnd as always, if you want to get involved or in touch, check out Starlite on [GitHub](https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/) or [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/X3FJqy8d2j)!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/122ld24/starlite_updates_march_22_20_is_coming/","created":"2023-03-26","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":23},"text":"Starlite updates March '22 | 2.0 is coming **Disclaimer**: It says \"March '22\" in the title but it should say \"March '23\".

By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in HuggingFace, HuggingGPT is able to cover numerous sophisticated AI tasks in different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards AGI.","classes":{"dataset":0.0426610149,"prompteng":0.0412500128}}
{"title":"Yes but.. Can ChatGPT Identify Entities in Historical Documents?","description":"Large language models (LLMs) have been leveraged for several years now, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in recognizing entities from modern documents. For the last few months, the conversational agent ChatGPT has \"prompted\" a lot of interest in the scientific community and public due to its capacity of generating plausible-sounding answers. In this paper, we explore this ability by probing it in the named entity recognition and classification (NERC) task in primary sources (e.g., historical newspapers and classical commentaries) in a zero-shot manner and by comparing it with state-of-the-art LM-based systems. Our findings indicate several shortcomings in identifying entities in historical text that range from the consistency of entity annotation guidelines, entity complexity, and code-switching, to the specificity of prompting. Moreover, as expected, the inaccessibility of historical archives to the public (and thus on the Internet) also impacts its performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17322v1","created":"2023-03-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""},"text":"Yes but..

Not limited to content generation, DGMs are also widely adopted in Internet of Things, Metaverse, and digital twin, due to their outstanding ability to represent complex patterns and generate plausible samples. In this article, we explore the applications of DGMs in a crucial task, i.e., improving the efficiency of wireless network management. Specifically, we firstly overview the generative AI, as well as three representative DGMs. Then, a DGM-empowered framework for wireless network management is proposed, in which we elaborate the issues of the conventional network management approaches, why DGMs can address them efficiently, and the step-by-step workflow for applying DGMs in managing wireless networks. Moreover, we conduct a case study on network economics, using the state-of-the-art DGM model, i.e., diffusion model, to generate effective contracts for incentivizing the mobile AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services. Last but not least, we discuss important open directions for the further research.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17114v1","created":"2023-03-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""},"text":"Deep Generative Model and Its Applications in Efficient Wireless Network Management: A Tutorial and Case Study With the phenomenal success of diffusion models and ChatGPT, deep generation models (DGMs) have been experiencing explosive growth from 2022.

{"title":"Iterative Prompt Learning for Unsupervised Backlit Image Enhancement","description":"We propose a novel unsupervised backlit image enhancement method, abbreviated as CLIP-LIT, by exploring the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) for pixel-level image enhancement. We show that the open-world CLIP prior not only aids in distinguishing between backlit and well-lit images, but also in perceiving heterogeneous regions with different luminance, facilitating the optimization of the enhancement network. Unlike high-level and image manipulation tasks, directly applying CLIP to enhancement tasks is non-trivial, owing to the difficulty in finding accurate prompts. To solve this issue, we devise a prompt learning framework that first learns an initial prompt pair by constraining the text-image similarity between the prompt (negative/positive sample) and the corresponding image (backlit image/well-lit image) in the CLIP latent space. Then, we train the enhancement network based on the text-image similarity between the enhanced result and the initial prompt pair. To further improve the accuracy of the initial prompt pair, we iteratively fine-tune the prompt learning framework to reduce the distribution gaps between the backlit images, enhanced results, and well-lit images via rank learning, boosting the enhancement performance. Our method alternates between updating the prompt learning framework and enhancement network until visually pleasing results are achieved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and generalization ability, without requiring any paired data.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17569v1","created":"2023-03-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Iterative Prompt Learning for Unsupervised Backlit Image Enhancement We propose a novel unsupervised backlit image enhancement method, abbreviated as CLIP-LIT, by exploring the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) for pixel-level image enhancement.

{"title":"Can I Trust My Simulation Model? Measuring the Quality of Business Process Simulation Models","description":"Business Process Simulation (BPS) is an approach to analyze the performance of business processes under different scenarios. For example, BPS allows us to estimate what would be the cycle time of a process if one or more resources became unavailable. The starting point of BPS is a process model annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model). BPS models may be manually designed, based on information collected from stakeholders and empirical observations, or automatically discovered from execution data. Regardless of its origin, a key question when using a BPS model is how to assess its quality. In this paper, we propose a collection of measures to evaluate the quality of a BPS model w.r.t. its ability to replicate the observed behavior of the process.

We evaluate the ability of the proposed measures to discern the impact of modifications to a BPS model, and their ability to uncover the relative strengths and weaknesses of two approaches for automated discovery of BPS models.

{"title":"Discriminative Class Tokens for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models","description":"Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the generation of diverse and high-quality images. However, generated images often fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This comes with a downside, doing so limits their expressive power: (i) supervised datasets are generally small compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image models are trained, and so the quality and diversity of generated images are severely affected, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to free-form text, which limits the control over the generated images.   In this work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier, which guides the generation. This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of a single input token of a text-to-image diffusion model, using the classifier, by steering generated images toward a given target class. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to train the guiding classifier.

Quick intro: NEOs are objects that approach the Sun within a distance of max. 1.3 AU. 1.0 AU corresponds to the average distance between Earth and Sun (around 150 Million km).\n\nYou may hear sometimes of these objects in the media when an asteroid is approaching us, is having a close flyby, or is detected before it vanishes while disintegrating in the night sky, [like this one](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64621721).\n\n*But how many objects are out there? Where are they and how do they \"travel\" around the Sun? Are they bright? If yes, how bright? How can we compute their brightness? Can we also model a theoretical distribution of NEOs to get an understanding where we have \"to look at\"? And what kind of telescopes are needed?*\n\nThese are ... a lot of questions. And in my 16 parts tutorial I try to tackle all questions as thoroughly as possible. If you are interested in getting an understanding how this particular topic is handled in \"space science\", feel free to take a look at my GitHub repository and the corresponding explanatory videos.\n\nSpace Science is approachable; and there are tons of libraries and Open Access data for Python.

A privacy-enhanced version of this mechanism also employs an additional layer of privacy protection by training a randomisation layer at the end of the client-side model.

Moreover, our approach is not limited to text-to-video synthesis but is also applicable to other tasks such as conditional and content-specialized video generation, and Video Instruct-Pix2Pix, i.e., instruction-guided video editing.   As experiments show, our method performs comparably or sometimes better than recent approaches, despite not being trained on additional video data. Our code will be open sourced at: https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/Text2Video-Zero .","classes":{"dataset":0.2314282656,"prompteng":0.0033437952}}
{"title":"FS-Real: Towards Real-World Cross-Device Federated Learning","description":"Federated Learning (FL) aims to train high-quality models in collaboration with distributed clients while not uploading their local data, which attracts increasing attention in both academia and industry. However, there is still a considerable gap between the flourishing FL research and real-world scenarios, mainly caused by the characteristics of heterogeneous devices and its scales. Most existing works conduct evaluations with homogeneous devices, which are mismatched with the diversity and variability of heterogeneous devices in real-world scenarios. Moreover, it is challenging to conduct research and development at scale with heterogeneous devices due to limited resources and complex software stacks. These two key factors are important yet underexplored in FL research as they directly impact the FL training dynamics and final performance, making the effectiveness and usability of FL algorithms unclear. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable prototyping system for real-world cross-device FL, FS-Real. It supports heterogeneous device runtime, contains parallelism and robustness enhanced FL server, and provides implementations and extensibility for advanced FL utility features such as personalization, communication compression and asynchronous aggregation. To demonstrate the usability and efficiency of FS-Real, we conduct extensive experiments with various device distributions, quantify and analyze the effect of the heterogeneous device and various scales, and further provide insights and open discussions about real-world FL scenarios. Our system is released to help to pave the way for further real-world FL research and broad applications involving diverse devices and scales.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13363v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"FS-Real: Towards Real-World Cross-Device Federated Learning Federated Learning (FL) aims to train high-quality models in collaboration with distributed clients while not uploading their local data, which attracts increasing attention in both academia and industry.

{"title":"Considerations on the Evaluation of Biometric Quality Assessment Algorithms","description":"Quality assessment algorithms can be used to estimate the utility of a biometric sample for the purpose of biometric recognition. \"Error versus Discard Characteristic\" (EDC) plots, and \"partial Area Under Curve\" (pAUC) values of curves therein, are generally used by researchers to evaluate the predictive performance of such quality assessment algorithms. An EDC curve depends on an error type such as the \"False Non Match Rate\" (FNMR), a quality assessment algorithm, a biometric recognition system, a set of comparisons each corresponding to a biometric sample pair, and a comparison score threshold corresponding to a starting error. To compute an EDC curve, comparisons are progressively discarded based on the associated samples' lowest quality scores, and the error is computed for the remaining comparisons. Additionally, a discard fraction limit or range must be selected to compute pAUC values, which can then be used to quantitatively rank quality assessment algorithms.   This paper discusses and analyses various details for this kind of quality assessment algorithm evaluation, including general EDC properties, interpretability improvements for pAUC values based on a hard lower error limit and a soft upper error limit, the use of relative instead of discrete rankings, stepwise vs. linear curve interpolation, and normalisation of quality scores to a [0, 100] integer range. We also analyse the stability of quantitative quality assessment algorithm rankings based on pAUC values across varying pAUC discard fraction limits and starting errors, concluding that higher pAUC discard fraction limits should be preferred. The analyses are conducted both with synthetic data and with real data for a face image quality assessment scenario, with a focus on general modality-independent conclusions for EDC evaluations.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13294v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Considerations on the Evaluation of Biometric Quality Assessment Algorithms Quality assessment algorithms can be used to estimate the utility of a biometric sample for the purpose of biometric recognition. \"Error versus Discard Characteristic\" (EDC) plots, and \"partial Area Under Curve\" (pAUC) values of curves therein, are generally used by researchers to evaluate the predictive performance of such quality assessment algorithms.

{"title":"Enhancement of theColor Image Compression Using a New Algorithm based on Discrete Hermite Wavelet Transform","description":"The Internet has turned the entire world into a small village;this is because it has made it possible to share millions of images and videos. However, sending and receiving a huge amount of data is considered to be a main challenge. To address this issue, a new algorithm is required to reduce image bits and represent the data in a compressed form. Nevertheless, image compression is an important application for transferring large files and images. This requires appropriate and efficient transfers in this field to achieve the task and reach the best results. In this work, we propose a new algorithm based on discrete Hermite wavelets transformation (DHWT) that shows the efficiency and quality of the color images. By compressing the color image, this method analyzes it and divides it into approximate coefficients and detail coefficients after adding the wavelets into MATLAB. With Multi-Resolution Analyses (MRA), the appropriate filter is derived, and the mathematical aspects prove to be validated by testing a new filter and performing its operation. After the decomposition of the rows and upon the process of the reconstruction, taking the inverse of the filter and dealing with the columns of the matrix, the original matrix is improved by measuring the parameters of the image to achieve the best quality of the resulting image, such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), compression ratio (CR), bits per pixel (BPP), and mean square error (MSE).","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13175v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Enhancement of theColor Image Compression Using a New Algorithm based on Discrete Hermite Wavelet Transform The Internet has turned the entire world into a small village;this is because it has made it possible to share millions of images and videos.

{"title":"PanoHead: Geometry-Aware 3D Full-Head Synthesis in 360$^{\\circ}$","description":"Synthesis and reconstruction of 3D human head has gained increasing interests in computer vision and computer graphics recently. Existing state-of-the-art 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs) for 3D human head synthesis are either limited to near-frontal views or hard to preserve 3D consistency in large view angles. We propose PanoHead, the first 3D-aware generative model that enables high-quality view-consistent image synthesis of full heads in $360^\\circ$ with diverse appearance and detailed geometry using only in-the-wild unstructured images for training. At its core, we lift up the representation power of recent 3D GANs and bridge the data alignment gap when training from in-the-wild images with widely distributed views. Specifically, we propose a novel two-stage self-adaptive image alignment for robust 3D GAN training. We further introduce a tri-grid neural volume representation that effectively addresses front-face and back-head feature entanglement rooted in the widely-adopted tri-plane formulation. Our method instills prior knowledge of 2D image segmentation in adversarial learning of 3D neural scene structures, enabling compositable head synthesis in diverse backgrounds. Benefiting from these designs, our method significantly outperforms previous 3D GANs, generating high-quality 3D heads with accurate geometry and diverse appearances, even with long wavy and afro hairstyles, renderable from arbitrary poses. Furthermore, we show that our system can reconstruct full 3D heads from single input images for personalized realistic 3D avatars.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13071v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"PanoHead: Geometry-Aware 3D Full-Head Synthesis in 360$^{\\circ}$ Synthesis and reconstruction of 3D human head has gained increasing interests in computer vision and computer graphics recently.

{"title":"Controllable Inversion of Black-Box Face-Recognition Models via Diffusion","description":"Face recognition models embed a face image into a low-dimensional identity vector containing abstract encodings of identity-specific facial features that allow individuals to be distinguished from one another. We tackle the challenging task of inverting the latent space of pre-trained face recognition models without full model access (i.e. black-box setting). A variety of methods have been proposed in literature for this task, but they have serious shortcomings such as a lack of realistic outputs, long inference times, and strong requirements for the data set and accessibility of the face recognition model. Through an analysis of the black-box inversion problem, we show that the conditional diffusion model loss naturally emerges and that we can effectively sample from the inverse distribution even without an identity-specific loss. Our method, named identity denoising diffusion probabilistic model (ID3PM), leverages the stochastic nature of the denoising diffusion process to produce high-quality, identity-preserving face images with various backgrounds, lighting, poses, and expressions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of identity preservation and diversity both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Poor quality automated ground truth data and quick visual inspections efficiently train an initial base model, which is refined using a small set of more expensive human-generated ground truth data.

To better understand both phenomena, we introduce a new analysis technique called task exclusion comparison. If a model has seen a task and it has not forgotten all the task-specific features, then its representation for that task should be better than that of a model that was trained on similar tasks, but not that exact one. Our image classification experiments show that most task-specific features are quickly forgotten, in contrast to what has been suggested in the past.

To address this, we developed a reliable instrument to measure more holistic factors influencing teachers adoption of adaptive learning platforms in schools. In addition, we present the results of its implementation with school teachers (n=792) sampled from a large country-level population and use this data to predict teachers real-world engagement with the adaptive learning platform in schools. Our results show that although teachers knowledge, confidence and product quality are all important factors, they are not necessarily the only, may not even be the most important factors influencing the teachers engagement with AI platforms in schools. Not generating any additional workload, in-creasing teacher ownership and trust, generating support mechanisms for help, and assuring that ethical issues are minimised, are also essential for the adoption of AI in schools and may predict teachers engagement with the platform better.

Our results show that although teachers knowledge, confidence and product quality are all important factors, they are not necessarily the only, may not even be the most important factors influencing the teachers engagement with AI platforms in schools. Not generating any additional workload, in-creasing teacher ownership and trust, generating support mechanisms for help, and assuring that ethical issues are minimised, are also essential for the adoption of AI in schools and may predict teachers engagement with the platform better. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the value of factors identified to increase the real-world adoption and effectiveness of adaptive learning platforms by increasing the dimensions of variability in prediction models and decreasing the implementation variability in practice.","classes":{"dataset":0.0164156538,"prompteng":0.0028889831}}

{"title":"CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images","description":"Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum low-dose, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover, to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the gap between coarse prediction and standard PET.

{"title":"TagGPT: Large Language Models are Zero-shot Multimodal Taggers","description":"Tags are pivotal in facilitating the effective distribution of multimedia content in various applications in the contemporary Internet era, such as search engines and recommendation systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want.

{"title":"A Closer Look at Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation","description":"Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a complex task that involves accurately segmenting the corresponding sounding object based on audio-visual queries. Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) an unbiased dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class labels, and 2) a model capable of effectively linking audio information with its corresponding visual object. However, these two requirements are only partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work, we propose a new strategy to build cost-effective and relatively unbiased audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our strategy, called Visual Post-production (VPO), explores the observation that it is not necessary to have explicit audio-visual pairs extracted from single video sources to build such benchmarks. We also refine the previously proposed AVSBench to transform it into the audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmark AVSBench-Single+. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new pixel-wise audio-visual contrastive learning method to enable a better generalisation of the model beyond the training set. We verify the validity of the VPO strategy by showing that state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained with datasets built by matching audio and visual data from different sources or with datasets containing audio and visual data from the same video source produce almost the same accuracy. Then, using the proposed VPO benchmarks and AVSBench-Single+, we show that our method produces more accurate audio-visual semantic segmentation than SOTA models.

{"title":"MULLER: Multilayer Laplacian Resizer for Vision","description":"Image resizing operation is a fundamental preprocessing module in modern computer vision. Throughout the deep learning revolution, researchers have overlooked the potential of alternative resizing methods beyond the commonly used resizers that are readily available, such as nearest-neighbors, bilinear, and bicubic.

In this paper, we present an extremely lightweight multilayer Laplacian resizer with only a handful of trainable parameters, dubbed MULLER resizer. MULLER has a bandpass nature in that it learns to boost details in certain frequency subbands that benefit the downstream recognition models. We show that MULLER can be easily plugged into various training pipelines, and it effectively boosts the performance of the underlying vision task with little to no extra cost. Specifically, we select a state-of-the-art vision Transformer, MaxViT, as the baseline, and show that, if trained with MULLER, MaxViT gains up to 0.6% top-1 accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys 36% inference cost saving to achieve similar top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k, as compared to the standard training scheme.

Regardless of how that would mean re-hashing the model each time the model is trained on newer data which is computationally expensive and not a feasible solution for ML models that are trained on continuous data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model integrity-checking mechanism that uses model watermarking techniques to monitor the integrity of ML models.

Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance.

Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above.

{"title":"Robust propagation-based phase retrieval for CT in proximity to highly attenuating objects","description":"X-ray imaging is a fast, precise and non-invasive method of imaging which, combined with computed tomography, provides detailed 3D rendering of samples. Incorporating propagation-based phase contrast can vastly improve data quality for weakly attenuating samples via material-specific phase retrieval filters, allowing radiation exposure to be reduced. However, applying phase retrieval to multi-material phantoms complicates analysis by requiring a choice of which material boundary to tune the phase retrieval. Filtering for the boundary with strongest phase contrast increases noise suppression, but with the detriment of over-blurring other interfaces, potentially obscuring small or neighbouring features and removing quantitative sample information. Additionally, regions bounded by more than one material type inherently cannot be conventionally filtered to reconstruct the whole boundary.

It performs very well, it can recognize similar and not similar images in the same environment, like in a disco club it can divide in two separate clusters two images that have the same light type but different subjects.\n\nBy contrast, on some images, like this two (the beautiful Dome of Florence) it recognizes that the building is the same and it classifies them as similar images, but, despite the fact that the subject is the same, the angle of the photos and the photos themselves are very different.\n\n**This is the example:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmv4jq2qkxpa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d500b1318fcd6a1b3b5357bb1a00962a5df968b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thuqvsuqkxpa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=892e87a376ea41a62054d3ba042eda95fb47144e\n\nI'm processing and clustering the images this way:\n\n    encoded_images = model.encode(images, batch_size=128, convert_to_tensor=True)\n    processed_images = util.paraphrase_mining_embeddings(encoded_images)\n    near_duplicates = [image for image in processed_images if image[0] &gt; TRESHOLD] \n\nThen passing the result into \\`connected components\\` to cluster them.\n\nDo you know some other algorithm that can find similar-images better than this one?","classes":{"dataset":0.3910337687,"prompteng":0.3339669704}}
{"title":"[D] Is it possible to run large language models using NVIDIA Jetson products?","description":"Although I've had trouble finding exact VRAM requirement profiles for various LLMs, it looks like models around the size of LLaMA 7B and GPT-J 6B require something in the neighborhood of 32 to 64 GB of VRAM to run or fine tune.

{"title":"Are Diffusion Models Vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks?","description":"Diffusion-based generative models have shown great potential for image synthesis, but there is a lack of research on the security and privacy risks they may pose. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic images and member images). To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion.

However, the resulting lowpass subband, which shall be used as a downscaled representative of the whole original sequence, contains a lot of ghosting artifacts. This can be alleviated by incorporating motion compensation methods into the subband coder. This results in a high quality lowpass subband but also leads to a lower compression ratio. In order to cope with this, we introduce a new approach for improving the compression efficiency of compensated 3-D wavelet lifting by performing denoising in the update step.

{"title":"Why are FPGAs better than GPUs for deep learning?","description":"I've worked for some years developing scientific applications for GPUs. Recently we've been trying to integrate FPGAs into our technologies; and consequently I've been trying to understand what they are useful for.\n\nI've found many posts here and there that claim that FPGAs are better suited than GPUs to accelerate Deep Learning/AI workloads (for example, [this one by Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/programmable/fpga-gpu.html)). However, I don't understand why that would be the case. I think the problem is that all those posts try to explain what an FPGA is and what its differences are to a GPU, so that people that work on Deep Learning understand why they are better suited. Nevertheless, my position is exactly the opposite: I know quite well how a GPU works and what it is good for, I know well enough how an FPGA works and how it differs from a GPU, **but I do not know enough about Deep Learning** to understand why Deep Learning applicatios would benefit more from the special features of FPGAs rather than from the immense parallelism GPUs offers.\n\nAs far as I know, an FPGA will never beat a traditional GPU in terms of raw parallelism (or, if it does, it would be much less cost efficient). Thus, when it comes to matrix multiplications, i.e. the main operation in Deep Learning models, or convolutions, GPUs can parallelly work with much bigger matrices. The only explanation I can think of is that traditional Deep Learning applications don't necessarily use such big matrices, but rather smaller ones that can also be fully parallelized in FPGAs and benefit highly from custom-hardware optimizations (optimized matrix multiplications/tensor operations, working with reduced-bit values such as FP16, deep-pipeline parallelism, ...). However, given the recent increase in popularity of very complex models (GPT-3, dall-e, and the like) which boast using millions or even billions of parameters, it is hard to imagine that popular deep learning models work with small matrices of which fully parallel architectures can be synthesized in FPGAs.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any insight will be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10s3u1s/why_are_fpgas_better_than_gpus_for_deep_learning/","created":"2023-02-03","tags":["reddit","ml","deeplearning"],"meta":{"num_comments":6},"text":"Why are FPGAs better than GPUs for deep learning?

Beyond being static, most suffer from a need for high-performance systems with large amounts of compute and/or memory. This static and bloated nature not only limits the reusability of code, pipelines and all the computations that went into previous versions of a model architecture upon finding a better one. It also forces our preconceptions of what type of learning is best for the task and which degrees of freedom are needed onto the solution. Instead of perpetuating all these assumptions, I want to create a sort of AutoML capable, under the right conditions, of even developing a learning algorithm / model combination that can dynamically add or remove inputs and outputs subsequently incorporating them into the network with adaptive online self-directed learning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How?\n\nBasically, the idea in a nutshell is to use some form of NEAT ([neuro evolution of augmenting topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)) and have special nodes in the network that will be activated based on different criteria (depending on the node\u2019s allele for that gene). When activated, however, these special nodes would not send any input forward but instead apply some property change(s) to their connected nodes and/or edges (yes they can connect to an edge and they could choose a subset of their connections or just apply the change(s) to all or use a maximum number of connection hops, etc). It could also create and destroy nodes depending on the effects defined by the allele. There would also be different firing policies (like the normal always fire or thresholding with or without decay, etc.) for all nodes to allow for better leveraging of temporal dynamics. Basically every property of all these policies, including the policy template itself is a potential target for modification by the special neuromodulatory nodes along with the normal properties of a \u201cneuron\u201d like bias, input weights, activation function, aggregation function, etc. The fitness function would either be abstracted away by using rtNEAT in a simulated environment or just be a combined score over a set of simulated tasks. This should add a regularizing force if the tasks are similar enough to help enforce generalization of the evolved algorithms. There should be no limitation placed on cycles in the graph, in fact I would expect cycles to be part of the evolved solutions, which would make them dynamical systems.

As opposed to traditional summary metrics, we utilize a recently proposed representation of physical activity data as a distributional object, providing a more sophisticated and complete profile of individual energetic expenditure in all ranges of monitoring intensity. For the purpose of predicting these distributional objects, we propose a novel hybrid Frechet regression model and apply it to US population accelerometer data from NHANES 2011-2014. The semi-parametric character of the new model allows us to introduce non-linear effects for essential variables, such as age, that are known from a biological point of view to have nuanced effects on physical activity. At the same time, the inclusion of a global for linear term retains the advantage of interpretability for other variables, particularly categorical covariates such as ethnicity and sex.

{"title":"Unsupervised classification to improve the quality of a bird song recording dataset","description":"Open audio databases such as Xeno-Canto are widely used to build datasets to explore bird song repertoire or to train models for automatic bird sound classification by deep learning algorithms. However, such databases suffer from the fact that bird sounds are weakly labelled: a species name is attributed to each audio recording without timestamps that provide the temporal localization of the bird song of interest. Manual annotations can solve this issue, but they are time consuming, expert-dependent, and cannot run on large datasets. Another solution consists in using a labelling function that automatically segments audio recordings before assigning a label to each segmented audio sample. Although labelling functions were introduced to expedite strong label assignment, their classification performance remains mostly unknown. To address this issue and reduce label noise (wrong label assignment) in large bird song datasets, we introduce a data-centric novel labelling function composed of three successive steps: 1) time-frequency sound unit segmentation, 2) feature computation for each sound unit, and 3) classification of each sound unit as bird song or noise with either an unsupervised DBSCAN algorithm or the supervised BirdNET neural network. The labelling function was optimized, validated, and tested on the songs of 44 West-Palearctic common bird species. We first showed that the segmentation of bird songs alone aggregated from 10% to 83% of label noise depending on the species. We also demonstrated that our labelling function was able to significantly reduce the initial label noise present in the dataset by up to a factor of three. Finally, we discuss different opportunities to design suitable labelling functions to build high-quality animal vocalizations with minimum expert annotation effort.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07560v1","created":"2023-02-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Unsupervised classification to improve the quality of a bird song recording dataset Open audio databases such as Xeno-Canto are widely used to build datasets to explore bird song repertoire or to train models for automatic bird sound classification by deep learning algorithms.

Extensive experiments on six benchmark graph data further verify the effectiveness of our designed Mid-GCN in node classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art GCNs under various adversarial attack strategies.","classes":{"dataset":0.0178427286,"prompteng":0.0028011254}}
{"title":"Correlation-Aware Neural Networks for DDoS Attack Detection In IoT Systems","description":"We present a comprehensive study on applying machine learning to detect distributed Denial of service (DDoS) attacks using large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems. While prior works and existing DDoS attacks have largely focused on individual nodes transmitting packets at a high volume, we investigate more sophisticated futuristic attacks that use large numbers of IoT devices and camouflage their attack by having each node transmit at a volume typical of benign traffic. We introduce new correlation-aware architectures that take into account the correlation of traffic across IoT nodes, and we also compare the effectiveness of centralized and distributed detection models. We extensively analyze the proposed architectures by evaluating five different neural network models trained on a dataset derived from a 4060-node real-world IoT system. We observe that long short-term memory (LSTM) and a transformer-based model, in conjunction with the architectures that use correlation information of the IoT nodes, provide higher performance (in terms of F1 score and binary accuracy) than the other models and architectures, especially when the attacker camouflages itself by following benign traffic distribution on each transmitting node. For instance, by using the LSTM model, the distributed correlation-aware architecture gives 81% F1 score for the attacker that camouflages their attack with benign traffic as compared to 35% for the architecture that does not use correlation information. We also investigate the performance of heuristics for selecting a subset of nodes to share their data for correlation-aware architectures to meet resource constraints.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07982v1","created":"2023-02-15","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Correlation-Aware Neural Networks for DDoS Attack Detection In IoT Systems We present a comprehensive study on applying machine learning to detect distributed Denial of service (DDoS) attacks using large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems.

{"title":"Tight Auditing of Differentially Private Machine Learning","description":"Auditing mechanisms for differential privacy use probabilistic means to empirically estimate the privacy level of an algorithm. For private machine learning, existing auditing mechanisms are tight: the empirical privacy estimate (nearly) matches the algorithm's provable privacy guarantee. But these auditing techniques suffer from two limitations. First, they only give tight estimates under implausible worst-case assumptions (e.g., a fully adversarial dataset). Second, they require thousands or millions of training runs to produce non-trivial statistical estimates of the privacy leakage.   This work addresses both issues. We design an improved auditing scheme that yields tight privacy estimates for natural (not adversarially crafted) datasets -- if the adversary can see all model updates during training. Prior auditing works rely on the same assumption, which is permitted under the standard differential privacy threat model. This threat model is also applicable, e.g., in federated learning settings. Moreover, our auditing scheme requires only two training runs (instead of thousands) to produce tight privacy estimates, by adapting recent advances in tight composition theorems for differential privacy.

IoT devices control various functions in smart homes and buildings, smart cities, and smart factories, making these devices an attractive target for attackers.

{"title":"Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits","description":"The waning of Moore's Law has shifted the focus of the tech industry towards alternative methods for continued performance gains. While optimizing compilers are a standard tool to help increase program efficiency, programmers continue to shoulder much responsibility in crafting and refactoring code with better performance characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance improving code edits. We hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. We investigate these questions by curating a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits, PIE. PIE contains trajectories of programs, where a programmer begins with an initial, slower version and iteratively makes changes to improve the program's performance. We use PIE to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, we use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI's CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, we find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, for C++ and Python, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, we show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task.

{"title":"Quality vs. Quantity of Data in Contextual Decision-Making: Exact Analysis under Newsvendor Loss","description":"When building datasets, one needs to invest time, money and energy to either aggregate more data or to improve their quality. The most common practice favors quantity over quality without necessarily quantifying the trade-off that emerges. In this work, we study data-driven contextual decision-making and the performance implications of quality and quantity of data. We focus on contextual decision-making with a Newsvendor loss. This loss is that of a central capacity planning problem in Operations Research, but also that associated with quantile regression. We consider a model in which outcomes observed in similar contexts have similar distributions and analyze the performance of a classical class of kernel policies which weigh data according to their similarity in a contextual space. We develop a series of results that lead to an exact characterization of the worst-case expected regret of these policies. This exact characterization applies to any sample size and any observed contexts. The model we develop is flexible, and captures the case of partially observed contexts. This exact analysis enables to unveil new structural insights on the learning behavior of uniform kernel methods: i) the specialized analysis leads to very large improvements in quantification of performance compared to state of the art general purpose bounds. ii) we show an important non-monotonicity of the performance as a function of data size not captured by previous bounds; and iii) we show that in some regimes, a little increase in the quality of the data can dramatically reduce the amount of samples required to reach a performance target. All in all, our work demonstrates that it is possible to quantify in a precise fashion the interplay of data quality and quantity, and performance in a central problem class.

These range from computer vision tasks such as age estimation from photographs, to medical tasks such as ejection fraction estimation from echocardiograms for disease tracking. Semi-supervised approaches for deep regression are notably under-explored compared to classification and segmentation tasks, however. Unlike classification tasks, which rely on thresholding functions for generating class pseudo-labels, regression tasks use real number target predictions directly as pseudo-labels, making them more sensitive to prediction quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach to semi-supervised regression, namely Uncertainty-Consistent Variational Model Ensembling (UCVME), which improves training by generating high-quality pseudo-labels and uncertainty estimates for heteroscedastic regression. Given that aleatoric uncertainty is only dependent on input data by definition and should be equal for the same inputs, we present a novel uncertainty consistency loss for co-trained models. Our consistency loss significantly improves uncertainty estimates and allows higher quality pseudo-labels to be assigned greater importance under heteroscedastic regression. Furthermore, we introduce a novel variational model ensembling approach to reduce prediction noise and generate more robust pseudo-labels. We analytically show our method generates higher quality targets for unlabeled data and further improves training.

Furthermore, we introduce a novel variational model ensembling approach to reduce prediction noise and generate more robust pseudo-labels. We analytically show our method generates higher quality targets for unlabeled data and further improves training. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on different tasks and can be competitive with supervised methods that use full labels. Our code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/UCVME.","classes":{"dataset":0.1532259583,"prompteng":0.0073083737}}
{"title":"Enhancing Biogenic Emission Maps Using Deep Learning","description":"Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) play a critical role in biosphere-atmosphere interactions, being a key factor in the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere and climate. Acquiring large and fine-grained BVOC emission maps is expensive and time-consuming, so most of the available BVOC data are obtained on a loose and sparse sampling grid or on small regions. However, high-resolution BVOC data are desirable in many applications, such as air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climate monitoring. In this work, we propose to investigate the possibility of enhancing BVOC acquisitions, taking a step forward in explaining the relationships between plants and these compounds. We do so by comparing the performances of several state-of-the-art neural networks proposed for Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR), showing how to adapt them to correctly handle emission data through preprocessing. Moreover, we also consider realistic scenarios, considering both temporal and geographical constraints. Finally, we present possible future developments in terms of Super-Resolution (SR) generalization, considering the scale-invariance property and super-resolving emissions from unseen compounds.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07570v1","created":"2023-02-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Enhancing Biogenic Emission Maps Using Deep Learning Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) play a critical role in biosphere-atmosphere interactions, being a key factor in the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere and climate.

{"title":"Confidence Score Based Speaker Adaptation of Conformer Speech Recognition Systems","description":"Speaker adaptation techniques provide a powerful solution to customise automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for individual users. Practical application of unsupervised model-based speaker adaptation techniques to data intensive end-to-end ASR systems is hindered by the scarcity of speaker-level data and performance sensitivity to transcription errors. To address these issues, a set of compact and data efficient speaker-dependent (SD) parameter representations are used to facilitate both speaker adaptive training and test-time unsupervised speaker adaptation of state-of-the-art Conformer ASR systems. The sensitivity to supervision quality is reduced using a confidence score-based selection of the less erroneous subset of speaker-level adaptation data. Two lightweight confidence score estimation modules are proposed to produce more reliable confidence scores. The data sparsity issue, which is exacerbated by data selection, is addressed by modelling the SD parameter uncertainty using Bayesian learning. Experiments on the benchmark 300-hour Switchboard and the 233-hour AMI datasets suggest that the proposed confidence score-based adaptation schemes consistently outperformed the baseline speaker-independent (SI) Conformer model and conventional non-Bayesian, point estimate-based adaptation using no speaker data selection. Similar consistent performance improvements were retained after external Transformer and LSTM language model rescoring. In particular, on the 300-hour Switchboard corpus, statistically significant WER reductions of 1.0%, 1.3%, and 1.4% absolute (9.5%, 10.9%, and 11.3% relative) were obtained over the baseline SI Conformer on the NIST Hub5'00, RT02, and RT03 evaluation sets respectively. Similar WER reductions of 2.7% and 3.3% absolute (8.9% and 10.2% relative) were also obtained on the AMI development and evaluation sets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07521v1","created":"2023-02-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Confidence Score Based Speaker Adaptation of Conformer Speech Recognition Systems Speaker adaptation techniques provide a powerful solution to customise automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for individual users.

One critical aspect of testing is debugging, which involves finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program. In this article, we'll explore how to debug Python applications and highlight some of the most commonly used methods for debugging Python code.\n\n## Debugging options\n\nWhen it comes to debugging Python, there are multiple options available, and you should consider which one suits your needs best. Two popular options are IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools.\n\n## IDE Debugging Tools\n\nIDEs like PyCharm and VSCode offer debugging tools that allow you to set breakpoints in your code and run it in debug mode. This allows you to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. Here are some resources for learning how to use the debugging tools in PyCharm and VSCode:\n\n* [Debugging Python in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-your-first-python-application.html)\n* [Debugging Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)\n\n## Package Debugging Tools\n\nLinks:\n\n* [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)\n* [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/)\n* [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html)\n\nPython also offers built-in debugging tools, such as the `pdb` module, which allow you to set breakpoints and step through your code in a console-based debugger. Additionally, there are alternative packages like `ipdb`, which is based on the `IPython` tool and provides a more powerful debugger. Here is an example of how to use the `pdb` module in your code:\n\n**my\\_module.py**\n\n    def something(val: str) -&gt; int:\n        val += \" world\"\n        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n        # If you want a more powerful debugger, use `ipdb`.\n        # Note, that this requires installation of `ipdb`\n        #     $ pip install ipdb\n        # Then, comment out the `mport pdb; ...` and \n        # uncomment the following line:\n        # import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()\n    \n    my_str = \"Hello\"\n    \n    print(something(my_str))\n\nIn the example code above, we set a breakpoint in the `something()` function using the `pdb.set_trace()` function. When the code reaches this point, it will pause execution and drop into the debugger, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.\n\n**Run it**\n\n    python my_module.py\n\n**What would you see**\n\n    $ python my_module.py \n    --Return--\n    &gt; /home/artur.local/repos/tryouts/debug/my_module.py(3)something()-&gt;None\n    -&gt; import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n    (Pdb) locals()\n    {'val': 'Hello world', 'pdb': &lt;module 'pdb' from '/usr/lib64/python3.11/pdb.py'&gt;, '__return__': None}\n    (Pdb) val\n    'Hello world'\n    (Pdb)\n\nStudy `pdb` documentation for more.\n\n**Good to know**\n\nIt works similarly with your web views (like, FastAPI/Flask/Django).\n\n    def your_view(request):\n       # ...\n       import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n\n## Best Practices for Debugging Python\n\nWhile debugging is an essential part of the development process, there are some best practices to keep in mind to ensure that your code remains clean and maintainable.\n\n## Don't commit your debug code!\n\nLinks:\n\n* [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/)\n* [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)\n\nOne critical practice is to avoid committing your debug code to your code repository. Debug code can clutter your codebase and make it more challenging to maintain. To avoid committing debug code, use a tool like `pre-commit` and linters like `ruff` to catch and prevent it from being committed.\n\n## Debugging in Docker\n\nIf you use Docker for development, you need to configure your `docker-compose.yml` to allow debugging. You can do this by setting the `stdin_open` and `tty` options for your service:\n\n    version: '3'\n    \n    services:\n      api:\n        # Other configuration\n        stdin_open: true\n        tty: true\n\nAfter configuring your Docker environment, assuming that you have it running already, you can find the container ID (`CONTAINER ID`) for your service (in the example above - `api` service) using `docker ps` and attach to it with the `docker attach` (`docker attach {CONTAINER ID}`) command to start debugging. Note, that you will need to run the `docker attach` command in a separate shell/terminal tab and that's where the debug prompt will appear.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDebugging Python is an essential skill for any developer, and it's crucial to understand the available options and best practices. In this article, we explored two popular options for debugging Python: IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools. We also highlighted some best practices for debugging in Python, including avoiding committing debug code and configuring Docker for debugging.

Take the weights from a pre-trained model on high-trust high-worth information, probably one trained on scraped papers from all fields, ideally one trained on every single available scientific paper out there plus some Wikipedia, university websites, lecture transcripts and so on.\n2. Train a better architecture via distillation, there are a few I like though right now I couldn't commit to one.

{"title":"FUSQA: Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation Quality Assessment","description":"Deep learning models have been effective for various fetal ultrasound segmentation tasks. However, generalization to new unseen data has raised questions about their effectiveness for clinical adoption. Normally, a transition to new unseen data requires time-consuming and costly quality assurance processes to validate the segmentation performance post-transition. Segmentation quality assessment efforts have focused on natural images, where the problem has been typically formulated as a dice score regression task. In this paper, we propose a simplified Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation Quality Assessment (FUSQA) model to tackle the segmentation quality assessment when no masks exist to compare with. We formulate the segmentation quality assessment process as an automated classification task to distinguish between good and poor-quality segmentation masks for more accurate gestational age estimation. We validate the performance of our proposed approach on two datasets we collect from two hospitals using different ultrasound machines. We compare different architectures, with our best-performing architecture achieving over 90% classification accuracy on distinguishing between good and poor-quality segmentation masks from an unseen dataset. Additionally, there was only a 1.45-day difference between the gestational age reported by doctors and estimated based on CRL measurements using well-segmented masks. On the other hand, this difference increased and reached up to 7.73 days when we calculated CRL from the poorly segmented masks. As a result, AI-based approaches can potentially aid fetal ultrasound segmentation quality assessment and might detect poor segmentation in real-time screening in the future.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04418v1","created":"2023-03-08","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"FUSQA: Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation Quality Assessment Deep learning models have been effective for various fetal ultrasound segmentation tasks. However, generalization to new unseen data has raised questions about their effectiveness for clinical adoption. Normally, a transition to new unseen data requires time-consuming and costly quality assurance processes to validate the segmentation performance post-transition. Segmentation quality assessment efforts have focused on natural images, where the problem has been typically formulated as a dice score regression task. In this paper, we propose a simplified Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation Quality Assessment (FUSQA) model to tackle the segmentation quality assessment when no masks exist to compare with. We formulate the segmentation quality assessment process as an automated classification task to distinguish between good and poor-quality segmentation masks for more accurate gestational age estimation. We validate the performance of our proposed approach on two datasets we collect from two hospitals using different ultrasound machines.

{"title":"ElC-OIS: Ellipsoidal Clustering for Open-World Instance Segmentation on LiDAR Data","description":"Open-world Instance Segmentation (OIS) is a challenging task that aims to accurately segment every object instance appearing in the current observation, regardless of whether these instances have been labeled in the training set. This is important for safety-critical applications such as robust autonomous navigation. In this paper, we present a flexible and effective OIS framework for LiDAR point cloud that can accurately segment both known and unknown instances (i.e., seen and unseen instance categories during training). It first identifies points belonging to known classes and removes the background by leveraging close-set panoptic segmentation networks. Then, we propose a novel ellipsoidal clustering method that is more adapted to the characteristic of LiDAR scans and allows precise segmentation of unknown instances. Furthermore, a diffuse searching method is proposed to handle the common over-segmentation problem presented in the known instances. With the combination of these techniques, we are able to achieve accurate segmentation for both known and unknown instances. We evaluated our method on the SemanticKITTI open-world LiDAR instance segmentation dataset. The experimental results suggest that it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, especially with a 10.0% improvement in association quality. The source code of our method will be publicly available at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/ElC-OIS.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04351v1","created":"2023-03-08","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"ElC-OIS: Ellipsoidal Clustering for Open-World Instance Segmentation on LiDAR Data Open-world Instance Segmentation (OIS) is a challenging task that aims to accurately segment every object instance appearing in the current observation, regardless of whether these instances have been labeled in the training set.

{"title":"DroNeRF: Real-time Multi-agent Drone Pose Optimization for Computing Neural Radiance Fields","description":"We present a novel optimization algorithm called DroNeRF for the autonomous positioning of monocular camera drones around an object for real-time 3D reconstruction using only a few images. Neural Radiance Fields or NeRF, is a novel view synthesis technique used to generate new views of an object or scene from a set of input images. Using drones in conjunction with NeRF provides a unique and dynamic way to generate novel views of a scene, especially with limited scene capabilities of restricted movements. Our approach focuses on calculating optimized pose for individual drones while solely depending on the object geometry without using any external localization system. The unique camera positioning during the data-capturing phase significantly impacts the quality of the 3D model. To evaluate the quality of our generated novel views, we compute different perceptual metrics like the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure(SSIM). Our work demonstrates the benefit of using an optimal placement of various drones with limited mobility to generate perceptually better results.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04322v1","created":"2023-03-08","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"DroNeRF: Real-time Multi-agent Drone Pose Optimization for Computing Neural Radiance Fields We present a novel optimization algorithm called DroNeRF for the autonomous positioning of monocular camera drones around an object for real-time 3D reconstruction using only a few images.

Here's my take on it:\n\nEven though, as mentioned in the original thread, Rust is not a magical solution for anything, I think the language's features that make it less prone to bugs (mainly memory safety, AFAIK) could speed up improvements to Python. This could happen directly, or indirectly by simplifying contributions to the interpreter.\n\nSince the original discussion, the Linux kernel has started taking contributions in Rust. It'll probably be a very long time before the majority of the kernel is in Rust; if it is ever fully converted that will definitively take much longer. But this movement gives Rust a strong vote of credibility, and IMO a confident step in establishing Rust as the successor of C as de facto system language of the day (again, a confident *first* step).\n\nConnecting to the point above about Rust succeeding C, the Rust community seems a lot more prolific than C's while both C and C++ [were reported](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/) as being used much more than Rust in 2022. I believe Rust has the qualities to dominate many of the areas C dominates today, but that trend has definitely not materialized yet.

LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, such as books, news articles and social media posts, and learn to predict the next word given some previous words. They can also perform other tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing texts and translating languages.\n\nHowever, there is a debate among AI researchers about whether bigger LLMs are always better. Some argue that increasing the size of LLMs (in terms of parameters, data and computing power) will lead to more general and human-like intelligence. Others question this assumption and point out the limitations and challenges of scaling up LLMs.\n\nIn a recent article published in Nature , Anil Ananthaswamy explores this debate and examines the pros and cons of building bigger LLMs. He interviews several experts from academia and industry who share their views on the current state and future direction of AI research.\n\nOne of the main advantages of bigger LLMs is that they can achieve higher accuracy and performance on various natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks. For example, GPT-3 , one of the largest LLMs to date with 175 billion parameters, can generate convincing texts on almost any topic given a few words or sentences as input. It can also answer factual questions, write summaries and perform simple arithmetic.\n\nAnother benefit of bigger LLMs is that they can learn from more diverse and representative data sources, which can reduce bias and improve fairness. For instance, Google's LaMDA , an LLM with 137 billion parameters that can engage in open-ended conversations on any topic, was trained on text data from multiple languages and domains.\n\nHowever, bigger LLMs also come with significant drawbacks. One of them is the environmental cost of training them. According to a study by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst , training a large LLM can emit as much carbon dioxide as five cars over their lifetimes. Moreover, training bigger LLMs requires more specialized hardware and infrastructure, which increases the entry barrier for smaller research groups and organizations.\n\nAnother challenge of bigger LLMs is that they are not very interpretable or explainable. It is hard to understand how they make decisions or what they learn from their data. This poses ethical risks when deploying them in real-world applications that affect human lives, such as health care or education.\n\nA third limitation of bigger LLMs is that they are not truly intelligent or generalizable. They lack common sense reasoning, causal understanding and world knowledge that humans have. They also struggle to adapt to new situations or tasks that are different from their training data.\n\nTherefore, some researchers suggest that scaling up LLMs alone is not enough to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is defined as AI that can perform any intellectual task that humans can do. They propose alternative approaches that combine symbolic reasoning with neural networks , incorporate multimodal inputs such as images or sounds , or leverage human feedback or interaction .\n\nIn conclusion, building bigger LLMs has both advantages and disadvantages for advancing AI research.

Let me explain:\n\n**TL;DR** A `Venv` context manager to control `sys.path` \\+ other goodies.\n\nA few years ago, when building out the [plugin system](https://meerschaum.io/reference/plugins/writing-plugins/), I wanted each plugin (i.e. just a Python module) to be given its own virtual environment, a la `pipx`, into which the plugin's dependencies are installed. In hindsight, I may have been suffering from \"not-invented-here-syndrome\" and maybe should have used one of the 1000 other Python package management tools out there, but to be honest, I'm grateful I took the time to write it exactly how I planned on using the feature. Remember, this wasn't intended to be yet another `pip` clone but instead a controlled way to manage plugins (albeit a bit hacky).\n\nThe internals of the plugin system work something like this:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from meerschaum.utils.packages import pip_install\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; pip_install('requests', venv='foo')\n    True\n\nThis creates a new venv `foo` (stored as  `~/.config/meerschaum/venvs/foo`) and installs `requests`. Another way to invoke this is through the CLI (though this will trigger installs for other internal components):\n\n    $ mrsm install package requests --venv foo\n\nNow you can use the `Venv` context manager to activate and import from this venv without having to fuss with `sys.path`, `threading.RLock`, or anything like that:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; import meerschaum as mrsm\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; with mrsm.Venv('foo'):\n    ...     import requests\n    ... \n    &gt;&gt;&gt; requests\n    &lt;module 'requests' from '/root/.config/meerschaum/venvs/foo/lib/python3.12/site-packages/requests/__init__.py'&gt;\n\nAgain, this is a supporting feature, but if there's demand for it, I've been considering separating the [venv module](https://docs.meerschaum.io/utils/venv/index.html) into its own package.\n\nI hope you found this insightful and that it contributes positively to the PEP 668 discussion!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11w83l6/in_light_of_pep_668_id_like_to_share_how_my/","created":"2023-03-20","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":5},"text":"In light of PEP 668, I'd like to share how my package handles virtual environments.

Therefore, how to evaluate the quality of the enhanced video in a way consistent with human visual perception is an important research topic. However, most video quality assessment methods mainly calculate video quality by estimating the distortion degrees of videos from an overall perspective. Few researchers have specifically proposed a video quality assessment method for video enhancement, and there is also no comprehensive video quality assessment dataset available in public. Therefore, we construct a Video quality assessment dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement (VDPVE) in this paper. The VDPVE has 1211 videos with different enhancements, which can be divided into three sub-datasets: the first sub-dataset has 600 videos with color, brightness, and contrast enhancements; the second sub-dataset has 310 videos with deblurring; and the third sub-dataset has 301 deshaked videos. We invited 21 subjects (20 valid subjects) to rate all enhanced videos in the VDPVE.

{"title":"Fairness-aware Differentially Private Collaborative Filtering","description":"Recently, there has been an increasing adoption of differential privacy guided algorithms for privacy-preserving machine learning tasks. However, the use of such algorithms comes with trade-offs in terms of algorithmic fairness, which has been widely acknowledged. Specifically, we have empirically observed that the classical collaborative filtering method, trained by differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), results in a disparate impact on user groups with respect to different user engagement levels. This, in turn, causes the original unfair model to become even more biased against inactive users. To address the above issues, we propose \\textbf{DP-Fair}, a two-stage framework for collaborative filtering based algorithms. Specifically, it combines differential privacy mechanisms with fairness constraints to protect user privacy while ensuring fair recommendations.

The increasing usage of SSL has led to an uptick in security research related to SSL encoders and the development of various Trojan attacks. The danger posed by Trojan attacks inserted in SSL encoders lies in their ability to operate covertly and spread widely among various users and devices. The presence of backdoor behavior in Trojaned encoders can inadvertently be inherited by downstream classifiers, making it even more difficult to detect and mitigate the threat. Although current Trojan detection methods in supervised learning can potentially safeguard SSL downstream classifiers, identifying and addressing triggers in the SSL encoder before its widespread dissemination is a challenging task. This is because downstream tasks are not always known, dataset labels are not available, and even the original training dataset is not accessible during the SSL encoder Trojan detection. This paper presents an innovative technique called SSL-Cleanse that is designed to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks in SSL encoders. We evaluated SSL-Cleanse on various datasets using 300 models, achieving an average detection success rate of 83.7% on ImageNet-100. After mitigating backdoors, on average, backdoored encoders achieve 0.24% attack success rate without great accuracy loss, proving the effectiveness of SSL-Cleanse.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09079v1","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"SSL-Cleanse: Trojan Detection and Mitigation in Self-Supervised Learning Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a commonly used approach to learning and encoding data representations.

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using ChatGPT in experiments on using ChatGPT to translate radiology reports into plain language for patients and healthcare providers so that they are educated for improved healthcare. Radiology reports from 62 low-dose chest CT lung cancer screening scans and 76 brain MRI metastases screening scans were collected in the first half of February for this study. According to the evaluation by radiologists, ChatGPT can successfully translate radiology reports into plain language with an average score of 4.1 in the five-point system with 0.07 places of information missing and 0.11 places of misinformation. In terms of the suggestions provided by ChatGPT, they are general relevant such as keeping following-up with doctors and closely monitoring any symptoms, and for about 37% of 138 cases in total ChatGPT offers specific suggestions based on findings in the report. ChatGPT also presents some randomness in its responses with occasionally over-simplified or neglected information, which can be mitigated using a more detailed prompt. Furthermore, ChatGPT results are compared with a newly released large model GPT-4, showing that GPT-4 can significantly improve the quality of translated reports.

However, large web-scale datasets such as LAION are largely uncurated beyond searches for exact duplicates, potentially leaving much redundancy. Here, we introduce SemDeDup, a method which leverages embeddings from pre-trained models to identify and remove semantic duplicates: data pairs which are semantically similar, but not exactly identical. Removing semantic duplicates preserves performance and speeds up learning. Analyzing a subset of LAION, we show that SemDeDup can remove 50% of the data with minimal performance loss, effectively halving training time. Moreover, performance increases out of distribution. Also, analyzing language models trained on C4, a partially curated dataset, we show that SemDeDup improves over prior approaches while providing efficiency gains. SemDeDup provides an example of how simple ways of leveraging quality embeddings can be used to make models learn faster with less data.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09540v1","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"SemDeDup: Data-efficient learning at web-scale through semantic deduplication Progress in machine learning has been driven in large part by massive increases in data.

{"title":"Improving Automated Hemorrhage Detection in Sparse-view Computed Tomography via Deep Convolutional Neural Network based Artifact Reduction","description":"Intracranial hemorrhage poses a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. For diagnosis, a Cranial Computed Tomography (CCT) scan is usually performed. However, the increased health risk caused by radiation is a concern. The most important strategy to reduce this potential risk is to keep the radiation dose as low as possible and consistent with the diagnostic task. Sparse-view CT can be an effective strategy to reduce dose by reducing the total number of views acquired, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we use a U-Net architecture to reduce artifacts from sparse-view CCTs, predicting fully sampled reconstructions from sparse-view ones. We evaluate the hemorrhage detectability in the predicted CCTs with a hemorrhage classification convolutional neural network, trained on fully sampled CCTs to detect and classify different sub-types of hemorrhages. Our results suggest that the automated classification and detection accuracy of hemorrhages in sparse-view CCTs can be improved substantially by the U-Net. This demonstrates the feasibility of rapid automated hemorrhage detection on low-dose CT data to assist radiologists in routine clinical practice.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09340v1","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Improving Automated Hemorrhage Detection in Sparse-view Computed Tomography via Deep Convolutional Neural Network based Artifact Reduction Intracranial hemorrhage poses a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment.

Therefore, we aim to explore the capability and improve the performance of GAN methods for food image generation. Specifically, we first choose StyleGAN3 as the baseline method to generate synthetic food images and analyze the performance. Then, we identify two issues that can cause performance degradation on food images during the training phase: (1) inter-class feature entanglement during multi-food classes training and (2) loss of high-resolution detail during image downsampling. To address both issues, we propose to train one food category at a time to avoid feature entanglement and leverage image patches cropped from high-resolution datasets to retain fine details. We evaluate our method on the Food-101 dataset and show improved quality of generated synthetic food images compared with the baseline.

{"title":"Tracking Different Ant Species: An Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Framework and a Dataset for Multi-object Tracking","description":"Tracking individuals is a vital part of many experiments conducted to understand collective behaviour. Ants are the paradigmatic model system for such experiments but their lack of individually distinguishing visual features and their high colony densities make it extremely difficult to perform reliable tracking automatically. Additionally, the wide diversity of their species' appearances makes a generalized approach even harder. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-object tracker that, for the first time, employs domain adaptation to achieve the required generalisation. This approach is built upon a joint-detection-and-tracking framework that is extended by a set of domain discriminator modules integrating an adversarial training strategy in addition to the tracking loss. In addition to this novel domain-adaptive tracking framework, we present a new dataset and a benchmark for the ant tracking problem. The dataset contains 57 video sequences with full trajectory annotation, including 30k frames captured from two different ant species moving on different background patterns. It comprises 33 and 24 sequences for source and target domains, respectively. We compare our proposed framework against other domain-adaptive and non-domain-adaptive multi-object tracking baselines using this dataset and show that incorporating domain adaptation at multiple levels of the tracking pipeline yields significant improvements.

However, federated learning faces severe optimization difficulty when training samples are not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). In this paper, we point out that the client sampling practice plays a decisive role in the aforementioned optimization difficulty. We find that the negative client sampling will cause the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients heavily inconsistent with that of all available clients, and further make the aggregated gradient unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning rate adaptation mechanism to adaptively adjust the server learning rate for the aggregated gradient in each round, according to the consistency between the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients and that of all available clients. Specifically, we make theoretical deductions to find a meaningful and robust indicator that is positively related to the optimal server learning rate and can effectively reflect the merged data distribution of sampled clients, and we utilize it for the server learning rate adaptation.

{"title":"A Linear Reconstruction Approach for Attribute Inference Attacks against Synthetic Data","description":"Personal data collected at scale from surveys or digital devices offers important insights for statistical analysis and scientific research. Safely sharing such data while protecting privacy is however challenging. Anonymization allows data to be shared while minimizing privacy risks, but traditional anonymization techniques have been repeatedly shown to provide limited protection against re-identification attacks in practice. Among modern anonymization techniques, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a potential solution to find a good tradeoff between privacy and statistical utility. Synthetic data is typically generated using algorithms that learn the statistical distribution of the original records, to then generate \"artificial\" records that are structurally and statistically similar to the original ones. Yet, the fact that synthetic records are \"artificial\" does not, per se, guarantee that privacy is protected. In this work, we systematically evaluate the tradeoffs between protecting privacy and preserving statistical utility for a wide range of synthetic data generation algorithms. Modeling privacy as protection against attribute inference attacks (AIAs), we extend and adapt linear reconstruction attacks, which have not been previously studied in the context of synthetic data. While prior work suggests that AIAs may be effective only on few outlier records, we show they can be very effective even on randomly selected records. We evaluate attacks on synthetic datasets ranging from 10^3 to 10^6 records, showing that even for the same generative model, the attack effectiveness can drastically increase when a larger number of synthetic records is generated. Overall, our findings prove that synthetic data is subject to privacy-utility tradeoffs just like other anonymization techniques: when good utility is preserved, attribute inference can be a risk for many data subjects.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10053v1","created":"2023-01-24","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"A Linear Reconstruction Approach for Attribute Inference Attacks against Synthetic Data Personal data collected at scale from surveys or digital devices offers important insights for statistical analysis and scientific research.

{"title":"Demystifying NFT Promotion and Phishing Scams","description":"The popularity and hype around purchasing digital assets such as art, video, and music in the form of Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has rapidly made them a lucrative investment opportunity, with NFT-based sales surpassing $25B in 2021 alone. However, the volatility and scarcity of NFTs, combined with the general lack of familiarity with the technical aspects of this ecosystem, encourage the spread of several scams. The success of an NFT is majorly impacted by its online virality. There have been sparse reports about scammers emulating this virality by either promoting their fraudulent NFT projects on social media or imitating other popular NFT projects. This paper presents a longitudinal analysis of 439 unique Twitter accounts that consistently promote fraudulent NFT collections through giveaway competitions and 1,028 NFT phishing attacks. Our findings indicate that most accounts interacting with these promotions are bots, which can rapidly increase the popularity of the fraudulent NFT collections by inflating their likes, followers, and retweet counts. This leads to significant engagement from real users, who then proceed to invest in the scams. On the other hand, we identify two novel attack vectors which are utilized by NFT phishing scams to steal funds and digital assets from the victim's wallet. We also identify several gaps in the prevalent anti-phishing ecosystem by evaluating the performance of popular anti-phishing blocklists and security tools against NFT phishing attacks.

{"title":"DODEM: DOuble DEfense Mechanism Against Adversarial Attacks Towards Secure Industrial Internet of Things Analytics","description":"Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) is a collaboration of devices, sensors, and networking equipment to monitor and collect data from industrial operations. Machine learning (ML) methods use this data to make high-level decisions with minimal human intervention. Data-driven predictive maintenance (PDM) is a crucial ML-based I-IoT application to find an optimal maintenance schedule for industrial assets. The performance of these ML methods can seriously be threatened by adversarial attacks where an adversary crafts perturbed data and sends it to the ML model to deteriorate its prediction performance. The models should be able to stay robust against these attacks where robustness is measured by how much perturbation in input data affects model performance. Hence, there is a need for effective defense mechanisms that can protect these models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a double defense mechanism to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks in I-IoT environments. We first detect if there is an adversarial attack on a given sample using novelty detection algorithms. Then, based on the outcome of our algorithm, marking an instance as attack or normal, we select adversarial retraining or standard training to provide a secondary defense layer. If there is an attack, adversarial retraining provides a more robust model, while we apply standard training for regular samples. Since we may not know if an attack will take place, our adaptive mechanism allows us to consider irregular changes in data. The results show that our double defense strategy is highly efficient where we can improve model robustness by up to 64.6% and 52% compared to standard and adversarial retraining, respectively.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09740v1","created":"2023-01-23","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"DODEM: DOuble DEfense Mechanism Against Adversarial Attacks Towards Secure Industrial Internet of Things Analytics Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) is a collaboration of devices, sensors, and networking equipment to monitor and collect data from industrial operations.

{"title":"Label Inference Attack against Split Learning under Regression Setting","description":"As a crucial building block in vertical Federated Learning (vFL), Split Learning (SL) has demonstrated its practice in the two-party model training collaboration, where one party holds the features of data samples and another party holds the corresponding labels. Such method is claimed to be private considering the shared information is only the embedding vectors and gradients instead of private raw data and labels. However, some recent works have shown that the private labels could be leaked by the gradients. These existing attack only works under the classification setting where the private labels are discrete. In this work, we step further to study the leakage in the scenario of the regression model, where the private labels are continuous numbers (instead of discrete labels in classification). This makes previous attacks harder to infer the continuous labels due to the unbounded output range.

Such method is claimed to be private considering the shared information is only the embedding vectors and gradients instead of private raw data and labels. However, some recent works have shown that the private labels could be leaked by the gradients. These existing attack only works under the classification setting where the private labels are discrete. In this work, we step further to study the leakage in the scenario of the regression model, where the private labels are continuous numbers (instead of discrete labels in classification). This makes previous attacks harder to infer the continuous labels due to the unbounded output range.

{"title":"Graph Topology Learning Under Privacy Constraints","description":"Graph learning, which aims to infer the underlying topology behind high dimension data, has attracted intense attention. In this study, we shed a new light on graph learning by considering a pragmatic scenario where data are privacy sensitive and located in separated clients (devices or organizations). The main difficulty in learning graphs in this scenario is that we cannot process all the data in a central server, because the data are not allowed to leave the local clients due to privacy concerns. The problem becomes more challenging when data of different clients are non-IID, since it is unreasonable to learn a global graph for heterogeneous data. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework in which a personalized graph for each client and a consensus graph are jointly learned in a federated fashion. Specifically, we commute model updates instead of raw data to the central server in the proposed federated algorithm. A provable convergence analysis shows that the algorithm enjoys $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. To further enhance privacy, we design a deferentially privacy algorithm to prevent the information of the raw data from being leaked when transferring model updates. A theoretical guidance is provided on how to ensure that the algorithm satisfies differential privacy. We also analyze the impact of differential privacy on the convergence of our algorithm.

To illustrate our techniques, we consider two problems: recovery of stochastic block models and learning mixtures of spherical Gaussians. For the former, we present the first efficient $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private algorithm for both weak recovery and exact recovery. Previously known algorithms achieving comparable guarantees required quasi-polynomial time.

In the spirit of developing attacks to better understand trustworthiness, we developed three techniques to drastically enhance prediction performance of classifiers with minimal changes to features, including the enhancement of 1) within-dataset predictions, 2) a particular method over another, and 3) cross-dataset generalization. Our within-dataset enhancement framework falsely improved classifiers' accuracy from 50% to almost 100% while maintaining high feature similarities between original and enhanced data (Pearson's r's>0.99). Similarly, the method-specific enhancement framework was effective in falsely improving the performance of one method over another.

{"title":"PMP: Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile against Sensitive Pattern Inference for Time Series","description":"Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive fine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for the development of data-driven services and applications. During the process, data sharing is often involved to allow the third-party modelers to perform specific time series data mining (TSDM) tasks based on the need of data owner. The high resolution of TS brings new challenges in protecting privacy. While meaningful information in high-resolution TS shifts from concrete point values to local shape-based segments, numerous research have found that long shape-based patterns could contain more sensitive information and may potentially be extracted and misused by a malicious third party. However, the privacy issue for TS patterns is surprisingly seldom explored in privacy-preserving literature. In this work, we consider a new privacy-preserving problem: preventing malicious inference on long shape-based patterns while preserving short segment information for the utility task performance. To mitigate the challenge, we investigate an alternative approach by sharing Matrix Profile (MP), which is a non-linear transformation of original data and a versatile data structure that supports many data mining tasks. We found that while MP can prevent concrete shape leakage, the canonical correlation in MP index can still reveal the location of sensitive long pattern. Based on this observation, we design two attacks named Location Attack and Entropy Attack to extract the pattern location from MP. To further protect MP from these two attacks, we propose a Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile (PMP) via perturbing the local correlation and breaking the canonical correlation in MP index vector. We evaluate our proposed PMP against baseline noise-adding methods through quantitative analysis and real-world case studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01838v1","created":"2023-01-04","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"PMP: Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile against Sensitive Pattern Inference for Time Series Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive fine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for the development of data-driven services and applications.

Based on this observation, we design two attacks named Location Attack and Entropy Attack to extract the pattern location from MP. To further protect MP from these two attacks, we propose a Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile (PMP) via perturbing the local correlation and breaking the canonical correlation in MP index vector. We evaluate our proposed PMP against baseline noise-adding methods through quantitative analysis and real-world case studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","classes":{"dataset":0.0420949198,"prompteng":0.000686882}}

{"title":"Extending Source Code Pre-Trained Language Models to Summarise Decompiled Binaries","description":"Reverse engineering binaries is required to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable. Decompilers can transform the largely unreadable binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. However, reverse engineering is time-consuming, much of which is taken up by labelling the functions with semantic information.   While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help Reverse Engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task.   In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarise decompiled binary functions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model.   We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by generating synthetic datasets and deduplicating the data.   Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82, and 44.21 for summarising source, decompiled, and synthetically stripped decompiled code, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended to decompiled binaries successfully.

In semantic communications, both transmitter and receiver share some common knowledge, which can be used to extract small-size information at the transmitter and recover the original information at the receiver. Due to different design purposes, security issues in semantic communications have two unique features compared to standard bit-wise communications. First, an attacker in semantic communications considers not only the amount of stolen data but also the meanings of stolen data. Second, an attacker in semantic communication systems can attack not only semantic information transmission as done in standard communication systems but also attacks machine learning (ML) models used for semantic information extraction since most of semantic information is generated using ML based methods. Due to these unique features, in this paper, we present an overview on the fundamentals and key challenges in the design of secure semantic communication. We first provide various methods to define and extract semantic information.

{"title":"Training Differentially Private Graph Neural Networks with Random Walk Sampling","description":"Deep learning models are known to put the privacy of their training data at risk, which poses challenges for their safe and ethical release to the public. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent is the de facto standard for training neural networks without leaking sensitive information about the training data. However, applying it to models for graph-structured data poses a novel challenge: unlike with i.i.d. data, sensitive information about a node in a graph cannot only leak through its gradients, but also through the gradients of all nodes within a larger neighborhood. In practice, this limits privacy-preserving deep learning on graphs to very shallow graph neural networks. We propose to solve this issue by training graph neural networks on disjoint subgraphs of a given training graph. We develop three random-walk-based methods for generating such disjoint subgraphs and perform a careful analysis of the data-generating distributions to provide strong privacy guarantees.

{"title":"Efficient Exploration in Resource-Restricted Reinforcement Learning","description":"In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), performing actions requires consuming certain types of resources that are non-replenishable in each episode. Typical applications include robotic control with limited energy and video games with consumable items. In tasks with non-replenishable resources, we observe that popular RL methods such as soft actor critic suffer from poor sample efficiency. The major reason is that, they tend to exhaust resources fast and thus the subsequent exploration is severely restricted due to the absence of resources. To address this challenge, we first formalize the aforementioned problem as a resource-restricted reinforcement learning, and then propose a novel resource-aware exploration bonus (RAEB) to make reasonable usage of resources. An appealing feature of RAEB is that, it can significantly reduce unnecessary resource-consuming trials while effectively encouraging the agent to explore unvisited states. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAEB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies in resource-restricted reinforcement learning environments, improving the sample efficiency by up to an order of magnitude.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06988v1","created":"2022-12-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Efficient Exploration in Resource-Restricted Reinforcement Learning In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), performing actions requires consuming certain types of resources that are non-replenishable in each episode.

{"title":"Location analysis of players in UEFA EURO 2020 and 2022 using generalized valuation of defense by estimating probabilities","description":"Analyzing defenses in team sports is generally challenging because of the limited event data.

It is not constrained to extreme archetypal behaviors like current methods using reward shaping. In addition it achieves this through a single training loop, instead of the usual one loop per play-style.

{"title":"Multi-Environment Pretraining Enables Transfer to Action Limited Datasets","description":"Using massive datasets to train large-scale models has emerged as a dominant approach for broad generalization in natural language and vision applications. In reinforcement learning, however, a key challenge is that available data of sequential decision making is often not annotated with actions - for example, videos of game-play are much more available than sequences of frames paired with their logged game controls. We propose to circumvent this challenge by combining large but sparsely-annotated datasets from a \\emph{target} environment of interest with fully-annotated datasets from various other \\emph{source} environments. Our method, Action Limited PreTraining (ALPT), leverages the generalization capabilities of inverse dynamics modelling (IDM) to label missing action data in the target environment. We show that utilizing even one additional environment dataset of labelled data during IDM pretraining gives rise to substantial improvements in generating action labels for unannotated sequences. We evaluate our method on benchmark game-playing environments and show that we can significantly improve game performance and generalization capability compared to other approaches, using annotated datasets equivalent to only $12$ minutes of gameplay. Highlighting the power of IDM, we show that these benefits remain even when target and source environments share no common actions.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13337v2","created":"2022-11-23","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Multi-Environment Pretraining Enables Transfer to Action Limited Datasets Using massive datasets to train large-scale models has emerged as a dominant approach for broad generalization in natural language and vision applications.

The agent operates based on a visual representation of its surroundings, and thus has a restricted capability to observe the environment. A comparison between DQN, DQN-GRU, and DQN-LSTM is performed to examine each models capabilities with two different types of input. Through this evaluation, it is been shown that with equivalent training and analogous model architectures, a DQN model is able to outperform its recurrent counterparts.","classes":{"dataset":0.2920473218,"prompteng":0.0006815299}}
{"title":"Go-Explore Complex 3D Game Environments for Automated Reachability Testing","description":"Modern AAA video games feature huge game levels and maps which are increasingly hard for level testers to cover exhaustively. As a result, games often ship with catastrophic bugs such as the player falling through the floor or being stuck in walls. We propose an approach specifically targeted at reachability bugs in simulated 3D environments based on the powerful exploration algorithm, Go-Explore, which saves unique checkpoints across the map and then identifies promising ones to explore from. We show that when coupled with simple heuristics derived from the game's navigation mesh, Go-Explore finds challenging bugs and comprehensively explores complex environments without the need for human demonstration or knowledge of the game dynamics. Go-Explore vastly outperforms more complicated baselines including reinforcement learning with intrinsic curiosity in both covering the navigation mesh and number of unique positions across the map discovered. Finally, due to our use of parallel agents, our algorithm can fully cover a vast 1.5km x 1.5km game world within 10 hours on a single machine making it extremely promising for continuous testing suites.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00570v1","created":"2022-09-01","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Go-Explore Complex 3D Game Environments for Automated Reachability Testing Modern AAA video games feature huge game levels and maps which are increasingly hard for level testers to cover exhaustively.

{"title":"Automatic Testing and Validation of Level of Detail Reductions Through Supervised Learning","description":"Modern video games are rapidly growing in size and scale, and to create rich and interesting environments, a large amount of content is needed. As a consequence, often several thousands of detailed 3D assets are used to create a single scene. As each asset's polygon mesh can contain millions of polygons, the number of polygons that need to be drawn every frame may exceed several billions. Therefore, the computational resources often limit how many detailed objects that can be displayed in a scene. To push this limit and to optimize performance one can reduce the polygon count of the assets when possible. Basically, the idea is that an object at farther distance from the capturing camera, consequently with relatively smaller screen size, its polygon count may be reduced without affecting the perceived quality. Level of Detail (LOD) refers to the complexity level of a 3D model representation. The process of removing complexity is often called LOD reduction and can be done automatically with an algorithm or by hand by artists. However, this process may lead to deterioration of the visual quality if the different LODs differ significantly, or if LOD reduction transition is not seamless. Today the validation of these results is mainly done manually requiring an expert to visually inspect the results. However, this process is slow, mundane, and therefore prone to error. Herein we propose a method to automate this process based on the use of deep convolutional networks. We report promising results and envision that this method can be used to automate the process of LOD reduction testing and validation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12674v1","created":"2022-08-25","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Automatic Testing and Validation of Level of Detail Reductions Through Supervised Learning Modern video games are rapidly growing in size and scale, and to create rich and interesting environments, a large amount of content is needed.

{"title":"DayDreamer: World Models for Physical Robot Learning","description":"To solve tasks in complex environments, robots need to learn from experience. Deep reinforcement learning is a common approach to robot learning but requires a large amount of trial and error to learn, limiting its deployment in the physical world. As a consequence, many advances in robot learning rely on simulators. On the other hand, learning inside of simulators fails to capture the complexity of the real world, is prone to simulator inaccuracies, and the resulting behaviors do not adapt to changes in the world. The Dreamer algorithm has recently shown great promise for learning from small amounts of interaction by planning within a learned world model, outperforming pure reinforcement learning in video games. Learning a world model to predict the outcomes of potential actions enables planning in imagination, reducing the amount of trial and error needed in the real environment. However, it is unknown whether Dreamer can facilitate faster learning on physical robots. In this paper, we apply Dreamer to 4 robots to learn online and directly in the real world, without simulators. Dreamer trains a quadruped robot to roll off its back, stand up, and walk from scratch and without resets in only 1 hour. We then push the robot and find that Dreamer adapts within 10 minutes to withstand perturbations or quickly roll over and stand back up. On two different robotic arms, Dreamer learns to pick and place multiple objects directly from camera images and sparse rewards, approaching human performance. On a wheeled robot, Dreamer learns to navigate to a goal position purely from camera images, automatically resolving ambiguity about the robot orientation. Using the same hyperparameters across all experiments, we find that Dreamer is capable of online learning in the real world, establishing a strong baseline.

To tackle this limitation, this work aims to adapt generative learning algorithms to model scientific experiments and accelerate their discovery using in-silico simulations.

A standard way to study this question abstractly is to ask how many samples an agent needs from the environment to learn an optimal policy for a $\\gamma$-discounted Markov decision process (MDP). For such an MDP, we design quantum algorithms that approximate an optimal policy ($\\pi^*$), the optimal value function ($v^*$), and the optimal $Q$-function ($q^*$), assuming the algorithms can access samples from the environment in quantum superposition. This assumption is justified whenever there exists a simulator for the environment; for example, if the environment is a video game or some other program.

For such an MDP, we design quantum algorithms that approximate an optimal policy ($\\pi^*$), the optimal value function ($v^*$), and the optimal $Q$-function ($q^*$), assuming the algorithms can access samples from the environment in quantum superposition.

{"title":"Controlled-rearing studies of newborn chicks and deep neural networks","description":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now achieve human-level performance on challenging object recognition tasks. CNNs are also the leading quantitative models in terms of predicting neural and behavioral responses in visual recognition tasks. However, there is a widely accepted critique of CNN models: unlike newborn animals, which learn rapidly and efficiently, CNNs are thought to be \"data hungry,\" requiring massive amounts of training data to develop accurate models for object recognition. This critique challenges the promise of using CNNs as models of visual development. Here, we directly examined whether CNNs are more data hungry than newborn animals by performing parallel controlled-rearing experiments on newborn chicks and CNNs. We raised newborn chicks in strictly controlled visual environments, then simulated the training data available in that environment by constructing a virtual animal chamber in a video game engine. We recorded the visual images acquired by an agent moving through the virtual chamber and used those images to train CNNs. When CNNs received similar visual training data as chicks, the CNNs successfully solved the same challenging view-invariant object recognition tasks as the chicks. Thus, the CNNs were not more data hungry than animals: both CNNs and chicks successfully developed robust object models from training data of a single object.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06106v1","created":"2021-12-12","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Controlled-rearing studies of newborn chicks and deep neural networks Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now achieve human-level performance on challenging object recognition tasks.

We identify and address lack of training data and mismatching tokenization algorithms as possible limitations of past attempts. In particular, we successfully pre-train and release ByGPT5, a new token-free decoder-only language model, and fine-tune it on a large custom corpus of English and German quatrains annotated with our styles. We show that ByGPT5 outperforms other models such as mT5, ByT5, GPT-2 and ChatGPT, while also being more parameter efficient and performing favorably compared to humans.

In contrast, end-to-end models would not suffer from the overhead of having to model prior knowledge and could learn the nuances of poetry from data alone, reducing the degree of human supervision required. In this work, we investigate end-to-end poetry generation conditioned on styles such as rhyme, meter, and alliteration. We identify and address lack of training data and mismatching tokenization algorithms as possible limitations of past attempts. In particular, we successfully pre-train and release ByGPT5, a new token-free decoder-only language model, and fine-tune it on a large custom corpus of English and German quatrains annotated with our styles. We show that ByGPT5 outperforms other models such as mT5, ByT5, GPT-2 and ChatGPT, while also being more parameter efficient and performing favorably compared to humans. In addition, we analyze its runtime performance and introspect the model's understanding of style conditions.

{"title":"The European AI Liability Directives -- Critique of a Half-Hearted Approach and Lessons for the Future","description":"As ChatGPT et al. conquer the world, the optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive and a revision of the Product Liability Directive. They constitute the final cornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a Brussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and beyond.   This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality.

Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond.

Study of temporal variability may provide a unique way to discriminate the imprint of the inner engine activity from geometry and propagation related effects. We define the minimum variability timescale (MVT) as the shortest duration of individual pulses that shape a light curve for a sample of GRBs and test correlations with peak luminosity, Lorentz factor, and jet opening angle. We compare these correlations with predictions from recent numerical simulations for a relativistic structured -- possibly wobbling -- jet and assess the value of MTV as probe of prompt-emission physics. We used the peak detection algorithm mepsa to identify the shortest pulse within a GRB time history and estimate its full width half maximum (FWHM).

We find that the peak of the photospheric component of the emission predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed prompt emission spectra in the majority of the bursts in our sample, with a radiative efficiency of about 10 per cent. Furthermore, we adopt two different approaches to correlate the peak energies of the bursts with the type of central engine to find that more bursts are compatible with a neutron star central engine compared to a black hole one.

This model is also 15% more sensitive in differentiating original and counterfactual examples, on three evaluation sets written by human workers and via human-AI collaboration.","classes":{"dataset":0.0131562585,"prompteng":0.5818995237}}
{"title":"Optimizing Prompts for Text-to-Image Generation","description":"Well-designed prompts can guide text-to-image models to generate amazing images. However, the performant prompts are often model-specific and misaligned with user input.

{"title":"Evidence of high latitude emission in the prompt phase of GRBs: How far from the central engine are the GRBs produced?","description":"The physical mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains elusive. One of the difficulties in nailing down their physical mechanism comes from the fact that there has been no clear observational evidence on how far from the central engine the prompt gamma-rays of GRBs are emitted while the competing physical mechanisms predict different characteristic distances. Here we present a simple study addressing this question by making use of the \"high-latitude emission\" (HLE). We show that our detailed numerical modeling exhibits a clear signature of HLE in the decaying phase of \"broad pulses\" of GRBs. We show that the HLE can emerge as a prominent spectral break in $F_{\\nu}$ spectra and dominate the peak of $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectra even while the \"line-of-sight emission\" (LoSE) is still ongoing, hence providing a new view of HLE emergence.

However, obtaining annotations of scene structure for videos requires a significant amount of effort to gather and annotate, making these methods expensive to train. In contrast, synthetic datasets generated by graphics engines provide powerful alternatives for generating scene-level annotations across multiple tasks. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage synthetic scene data for improving video understanding. We present a multi-task prompt learning approach for video transformers, where a shared video transformer backbone is enhanced by a small set of specialized parameters for each task. Specifically, we add a set of ``task prompts'', each corresponding to a different task, and let each prompt predict task-related annotations. This design allows the model to capture information shared among synthetic scene tasks as well as information shared between synthetic scene tasks and a real video downstream task throughout the entire network. We refer to this approach as ``Promptonomy'', since the prompts model a task-related structure.

To sort out this plethora of alternative approaches, several studies have benchmarked the performance of different explainers in terms of various explainability metrics. However, these earlier works make no attempts at providing insights into why different GNN architectures are more or less explainable, or which explainer should be preferred in a given setting.   In this survey, we fill these gaps by devising a systematic experimental study, which tests ten explainers on eight representative architectures trained on six carefully designed graph and node classification datasets.

GNN explainers have started to emerge in recent years, with a multitude of methods both novel or adapted from other domains. To sort out this plethora of alternative approaches, several studies have benchmarked the performance of different explainers in terms of various explainability metrics. However, these earlier works make no attempts at providing insights into why different GNN architectures are more or less explainable, or which explainer should be preferred in a given setting.   In this survey, we fill these gaps by devising a systematic experimental study, which tests ten explainers on eight representative architectures trained on six carefully designed graph and node classification datasets.

{"title":"Robust Preference Learning for Storytelling via Contrastive Reinforcement Learning","description":"Controlled automated story generation seeks to generate natural language stories satisfying constraints from natural language critiques or preferences. Existing methods to control for story preference utilize prompt engineering which is labor intensive and often inconsistent. They may also use logit-manipulation methods which require annotated datasets to exist for the desired attributes. To address these issues, we first train a contrastive bi-encoder model to align stories with corresponding human critiques, named CARP, building a general purpose preference model. This is subsequently used as a reward function to fine-tune a generative language model via reinforcement learning. However, simply fine-tuning a generative language model with a contrastive reward model does not always reliably result in a story generation system capable of generating stories that meet user preferences. To increase story generation robustness we further fine-tune the contrastive reward model using a prompt-learning technique. A human participant study is then conducted comparing generations from our full system, ablations, and two baselines. We show that the full fine-tuning pipeline results in a story generator preferred over a LLM 20x as large as well as logit-based methods.

While AI-driven agents can satisfy the first requirement, it is not yet possible to meet the second requirement automatically. Therefore, video game testing often still relies on manual testing, and human testers are required to play the game thoroughly to detect bugs. As a result, it is challenging to fully automate game testing. In this study, we explore the possibility of leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models for video game bug detection. By formulating the bug detection problem as a question-answering task, we show that large language models can identify which event is buggy in a sequence of textual descriptions of events from a game. To this end, we introduce the GameBugDescriptions benchmark dataset, which consists of 167 buggy gameplay videos and a total of 334 question-answer pairs across 8 games. We extensively evaluate the performance of six models across the OPT and InstructGPT large language model families on our benchmark dataset.

Similarly to their NLP counterparts, V\\&L models can be adapted to a downstream task by learning soft continuous prompts using a few training examples. Current methods learn the soft prompts by minimizing a cross-entropy loss using as class weights the features obtained by passing the prompts plus the class names through the text encoder. Such methods, however, significantly overfit the training data suffering from large accuracy degradation when tested on unseen classes from the same domain. Our main contribution, in this paper, is a surprisingly simple approach to alleviate this problem: we use a second cross entropy loss to minimize the distance between the learned soft prompts and a set of hand-engineered manual prompts (obtained by prompt engineering). The proposed loss can be interpreted in multiple ways including as a regularizer, as a means for language-based augmentation, and as a way of learning more discriminative class centroids. Importantly, our formulation is inherently amenable to including, during training, virtual classes, i.e. class names for which no visual samples are available, further increasing the robustness of the learned prompts. Through extensive evaluations on 11 datasets, we show that our approach (a) significantly outperforms all prior works on soft prompting, and (b) matches and surpasses, for the first time, the accuracy on novel classes obtained by hand-crafted prompts and CLIP for the majority of the test datasets.

{"title":"Prompt Emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the High-density Environment of Active Galactic Nuclei Accretion Disks","description":"Long and short gamma-ray bursts are traditionally associated with galactic environments, where circumburst densities are small or moderate (few to hundreds of protons per cubic cm). However, both are also expected to occur in the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei, where the ambient medium density can be much larger. In this work we study, via semi-analytical methods, the propagation of the GRB outflow, its interaction with the external material, and the ensuing prompt radiation. In particular, we focus on the case in which the external shock develops early in the evolution, at a radius that is smaller than the internal shock one. We find that bursts in such high density environments are likely characterized by a single, long emission episode that is due to the superposition of individual pulses, with a characteristic hard to soft evolution irrespective of the light curve luminosity. While multi-pulse light curves are not impossible, they would require the central engine to go dormant for a long time before re-igniting. In addition, short GRB engines would produce bursts with prompt duration that would exceed the canonical 2 s separation threshold and would likely be incorrectly classified as long events, even though they would not be accompanied by a simultaneous supernova. Finally, these events have a large dynamical efficiency which would produce a bright prompt emission followed by a somewhat dim afterglow.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14308v1","created":"2022-09-28","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Prompt Emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the High-density Environment of Active Galactic Nuclei Accretion Disks Long and short gamma-ray bursts are traditionally associated with galactic environments, where circumburst densities are small or moderate (few to hundreds of protons per cubic cm).

{"title":"Unsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining","description":"Recently, to improve the unsupervised image retrieval performance, plenty of unsupervised hashing methods have been proposed by designing a semantic similarity matrix, which is based on the similarities between image features extracted by a pre-trained CNN model.

In real-world scenarios, each image is associated with some concepts, and the similarity between two images will be larger if they share more identical concepts. Inspired by the above intuition, in this work, we propose a novel Unsupervised Hashing with Semantic Concept Mining, called UHSCM, which leverages a VLP model to construct a high-quality similarity matrix.

We simulate the time-dependent fluid distribution in the flow network based on a spatially explicit resistor network model with local fluid-storage capacitance. The shape of the surface is modeled by a spring network produced by a tethered mesh discretization, in which local bond rest lengths are adjusted instantaneously according to associated local fluid content in the capacitors in a quasi-static way.

{"title":"P2P: Tuning Pre-trained Image Models for Point Cloud Analysis with Point-to-Pixel Prompting","description":"Nowadays, pre-training big models on large-scale datasets has become a crucial topic in deep learning. The pre-trained models with high representation ability and transferability achieve a great success and dominate many downstream tasks in natural language processing and 2D vision. However, it is non-trivial to promote such a pretraining-tuning paradigm to the 3D vision, given the limited training data that are relatively inconvenient to collect. In this paper, we provide a new perspective of leveraging pre-trained 2D knowledge in 3D domain to tackle this problem, tuning pre-trained image models with the novel Point-to-Pixel prompting for point cloud analysis at a minor parameter cost. Following the principle of prompting engineering, we transform point clouds into colorful images with geometry-preserved projection and geometry-aware coloring to adapt to pre-trained image models, whose weights are kept frozen during the end-to-end optimization of point cloud analysis tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that cooperating with our proposed Point-to-Pixel Prompting, better pre-trained image model will lead to consistently better performance in 3D vision. Enjoying prosperous development from image pre-training field, our method attains 89.3% accuracy on the hardest setting of ScanObjectNN, surpassing conventional point cloud models with much fewer trainable parameters.

{"title":"No More Fine-Tuning? An Experimental Evaluation of Prompt Tuning in Code Intelligence","description":"Pre-trained models have been shown effective in many code intelligence tasks. These models are pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled corpus and then fine-tuned in downstream tasks.

Besides, the performance of fine-tuning strongly relies on the amount of downstream data, while in practice, the scenarios with scarce data are common. Recent studies in the natural language processing (NLP) field show that prompt tuning, a new paradigm for tuning, alleviates the above issues and achieves promising results in various NLP tasks. In prompt tuning, the prompts inserted during tuning provide task-specific knowledge, which is especially beneficial for tasks with relatively scarce data.

{"title":"CIRCLE: Continual Repair across Programming Languages","description":"Automatic Program Repair (APR) aims at fixing buggy source code with less manual debugging efforts, which plays a vital role in improving software reliability and development productivity. Recent APR works have achieved remarkable progress via applying deep learning (DL), particularly neural machine translation (NMT) techniques. However, we observe that existing DL-based APR models suffer from at least two severe drawbacks: (1) Most of them can only generate patches for a single programming language, as a result, to repair multiple languages, we have to build and train many repairing models. (2) Most of them are developed in an offline manner. Therefore, they won't function when there are new-coming requirements. To address the above problems, a T5-based APR framework equipped with continual learning ability across multiple programming languages is proposed, namely \\emph{C}ont\\emph{I}nual \\emph{R}epair a\\emph{C}ross Programming \\emph{L}anguag\\emph{E}s (\\emph{CIRCLE}). Specifically, (1) CIRCLE utilizes a prompting function to narrow the gap between natural language processing (NLP) pre-trained tasks and APR. (2) CIRCLE adopts a difficulty-based rehearsal strategy to achieve lifelong learning for APR without access to the full historical data.

Recent APR works have achieved remarkable progress via applying deep learning (DL), particularly neural machine translation (NMT) techniques. However, we observe that existing DL-based APR models suffer from at least two severe drawbacks: (1) Most of them can only generate patches for a single programming language, as a result, to repair multiple languages, we have to build and train many repairing models. (2) Most of them are developed in an offline manner. Therefore, they won't function when there are new-coming requirements.

{"title":"On LGRB progenitors: an approach from thermally-produced neutrinos","description":"Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are the most intense electromagnetic (EM) sources in the Universe. Long GRB (LGRB) correspond to those events with a typical prompt emission of more than a few seconds. It is generally assumed that they are originated after an implosion of a very massive star within a central compact object engine that can be either a black hole (BH) or a rapidly-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (NS). Nevertheless, one of the most challenging aspects of defining a unique model is that the progenitor remains initially hidden for direct EM observation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermally-produced neutrino properties in both GRB progenitors to provide an alternative solution. We consider the characteristics of both progenitors and the fireball scenario to calculate the oscillation probabilities within a three-flavor admixture regime. Then we obtain the expected neutrino ratio and we also estimate the number of events from these sources that could be detected in the future Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector, considering a sample of previously observed GRB with remarkably signs of being magnetar-produced. Our findings indicate that examining the predicted neutrino rates result in an additional mechanism to determine the type of progenitor associated with these events. This is especially useful when, for instance, we cannot directly observe an electromagnetic counterpart, such as so-called \"failed\" GRB with hidden jets, or when light curve analysis is inconclusive.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06967v1","created":"2022-05-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"On LGRB progenitors: an approach from thermally-produced neutrinos Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are the most intense electromagnetic (EM) sources in the Universe.

{"title":"Training Semantic Segmentation on Heterogeneous Datasets","description":"We explore semantic segmentation beyond the conventional, single-dataset homogeneous training and bring forward the problem of Heterogeneous Training of Semantic Segmentation (HTSS). HTSS involves simultaneous training on multiple heterogeneous datasets, i.e. datasets with conflicting label spaces and different (weak) annotation types from the perspective of semantic segmentation. The HTSS formulation exposes deep networks to a larger and previously unexplored aggregation of information that can potentially enhance semantic segmentation in three directions: i) performance: increased segmentation metrics on seen datasets, ii) generalization: improved segmentation metrics on unseen datasets, and iii) knowledgeability: increased number of recognizable semantic concepts.

HTSS involves simultaneous training on multiple heterogeneous datasets, i.e. datasets with conflicting label spaces and different (weak) annotation types from the perspective of semantic segmentation. The HTSS formulation exposes deep networks to a larger and previously unexplored aggregation of information that can potentially enhance semantic segmentation in three directions: i) performance: increased segmentation metrics on seen datasets, ii) generalization: improved segmentation metrics on unseen datasets, and iii) knowledgeability: increased number of recognizable semantic concepts.

{"title":"Surgical Aggregation: A Federated Learning Framework for Harmonizing Distributed Datasets with Diverse Tasks","description":"AI-assisted characterization of chest x-rays (CXR) has the potential to provide substantial benefits across many clinical applications. Many large-scale public CXR datasets have been curated for detection of abnormalities using deep learning. However, each of these datasets focus on detecting a subset of disease labels that could be present in a CXR, thus limiting their clinical utility. Furthermore, the distributed nature of these datasets, along with data sharing regulations, make it difficult to share and create a complete representation of disease labels. We propose surgical aggregation, a federated learning framework for aggregating knowledge from distributed datasets with different disease labels into a 'global' deep learning model. We randomly divided the NIH Chest X-Ray 14 dataset into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) splits with no patient overlap and conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, we pruned the disease labels to create two 'toy' datasets containing 11 and 8 labels respectively with 4 overlapping labels. For the second experiment, we pruned the disease labels to create two disjoint 'toy' datasets with 7 labels each. We observed that the surgically aggregated 'global' model resulted in excellent performance across both experiments when compared to a 'baseline' model trained on complete disease labels.

However, the full spectrum of challenges of egocentric tracking faced by an embodied AI is underrepresented in many existing datasets; these tend to focus on relatively short, third-person videos. Egocentric video has several distinguishing characteristics from those commonly found in past datasets: frequent large camera motions and hand interactions with objects commonly lead to occlusions or objects exiting the frame, and object appearance can change rapidly due to widely different points of view, scale, or object states. Embodied tracking is also naturally long-term, and being able to consistently (re-)associate objects to their appearances and disappearances over as long as a lifetime is critical. Previous datasets under-emphasize this re-detection problem, and their \"framed\" nature has led to adoption of various spatiotemporal priors that we find do not necessarily generalize to egocentric video. We thus introduce EgoTracks, a new dataset for long-term egocentric visual object tracking. Sourced from the Ego4D dataset, this new dataset presents a significant challenge to recent state-of-the-art single-object tracking models, which we find score poorly on traditional tracking metrics for our new dataset, compared to popular benchmarks.

{"title":"Predictions of photophysical properties of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes based on ensemble machine learning approach","description":"Phosphorescent metal complexes have been under intense investigations as emissive dopants for energy efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among them, cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes are widespread triplet emitters with color-tunable emissions. To render their practical applications as OLED emitters, it is in great need to develop Pt(II) complexes with high radiative decay rate constant ($k_r$) and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield. Thus, an efficient and accurate prediction tool is highly desirable. Here, we develop a general protocol for accurate predictions of emission wavelength, radiative decay rate constant, and PL quantum yield for phosphorescent Pt(II) emitters based on the combination of first-principles quantum mechanical method, machine learning (ML) and experimental calibration. A new dataset concerning phosphorescent Pt(II) emitters is constructed, with more than two hundred samples collected from the literature. Features containing pertinent electronic properties of the complexes are chosen. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning models combined with stacking-based approaches exhibit the best performance, where the values of squared correlation coefficients ($R^2$), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.96, 7.21 nm and 13.00 nm for emission wavelength prediction, and 0.81, 0.11 and 0.15 for PL quantum yield prediction. For radiative decay rate constant ($k_r$), the obtained value of $R^2$ is 0.67 while MAE and RMSE are 0.21 and 0.25 (both in log scale), respectively. The accuracy of the protocol is further confirmed using 24 recently reported Pt(II) complexes, which demonstrates its reliability for a broad palette of Pt(II) emitters.We expect this protocol will become a valuable tool, accelerating the rational design of novel OLED materials with desired properties.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05639v1","created":"2023-01-08","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Predictions of photophysical properties of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes based on ensemble machine learning approach Phosphorescent metal complexes have been under intense investigations as emissive dopants for energy efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).

{"title":"Augmenting Ego-Vehicle for Traffic Near-Miss and Accident Classification Dataset using Manipulating Conditional Style Translation","description":"To develop the advanced self-driving systems, many researchers are focusing to alert all possible traffic risk cases from closed-circuit television (CCTV) and dashboard-mounted cameras. Most of these methods focused on identifying frame-by-frame in which an anomaly has occurred, but they are unrealized, which road traffic participant can cause ego-vehicle leading into collision because of available annotation dataset only to detect anomaly on traffic video. Near-miss is one type of accident and can be defined as a narrowly avoided accident. However, there is no difference between accident and near-miss at the time before the accident happened, so our contribution is to redefine the accident definition and re-annotate the accident inconsistency on DADA-2000 dataset together with near-miss. By extending the start and end time of accident duration, our annotation can precisely cover all ego-motions during an incident and consistently classify all possible traffic risk accidents including near-miss to give more critical information for real-world driving assistance systems. The proposed method integrates two different components: conditional style translation (CST) and separable 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (S3D). CST architecture is derived by unsupervised image-to-image translation networks (UNIT) used for augmenting the re-annotation DADA-2000 dataset to increase the number of traffic risk accident videos and to generalize the performance of video classification model on different types of conditions while S3D is useful for video classification to prove dataset re-annotation consistency.

Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by incorporating self-training with contrastive learning. To better exploit the underlying semantic information of the image at different levels, we propose a Multi-level Semantic-guided Contrastive Domain Adaptation (MSCDA) framework to align the feature representation between domains. In particular, we extend the contrastive loss by incorporating pixel-to-pixel, pixel-to-centroid, and centroid-to-centroid contrasts to integrate semantic information of images. We utilize a category-wise cross-domain sampling strategy to sample anchors from target images and build a hybrid memory bank to store samples from source images. Two breast MRI datasets were retrospectively collected: The source dataset contains non-contrast MRI examinations from 11 healthy volunteers and the target dataset contains contrast-enhanced MRI examinations of 134 invasive breast cancer patients. We set up experiments from source T2W image to target dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-T1W image (T2W-to-T1W) and from source T1W image to target T2W image (T1W-to-T2W).

Removing instances with missing values can adversely affect the quality of further data analysis.

To preserve as much information as possible prior to modeling, a rigorous imputation scheme is acutely needed. While Denoising Autoencoders is a state-of-the-art method for imputation in high-dimensional data, they still require enough complete cases to be trained on which is often not available in real-world problems. In this paper, we consider missing value imputation as a multi-label classification problem and propose Chains of Autoreplicative Random Forests.

{"title":"MTNeuro: A Benchmark for Evaluating Representations of Brain Structure Across Multiple Levels of Abstraction","description":"There are multiple scales of abstraction from which we can describe the same image, depending on whether we are focusing on fine-grained details or a more global attribute of the image. In brain mapping, learning to automatically parse images to build representations of both small-scale features (e.g., the presence of cells or blood vessels) and global properties of an image (e.g., which brain region the image comes from) is a crucial and open challenge. However, most existing datasets and benchmarks for neuroanatomy consider only a single downstream task at a time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, annotations, and multiple downstream tasks that provide diverse ways to readout information about brain structure and architecture from the same image.

One obstacle to this endeavor are the different skeleton formats provided by different datasets, i.e., they do not label the same set of anatomical landmarks.

{"title":"Evaluating Generalizability of Deep Learning Models Using Indian-COVID-19 CT Dataset","description":"Computer tomography (CT) have been routinely used for the diagnosis of lung diseases and recently, during the pandemic, for detecting the infectivity and severity of COVID-19 disease. One of the major concerns in using ma-chine learning (ML) approaches for automatic processing of CT scan images in clinical setting is that these methods are trained on limited and biased sub-sets of publicly available COVID-19 data. This has raised concerns regarding the generalizability of these models on external datasets, not seen by the model during training. To address some of these issues, in this work CT scan images from confirmed COVID-19 data obtained from one of the largest public repositories, COVIDx CT 2A were used for training and internal vali-dation of machine learning models. For the external validation we generated Indian-COVID-19 CT dataset, an open-source repository containing 3D CT volumes and 12096 chest CT images from 288 COVID-19 patients from In-dia. Comparative performance evaluation of four state-of-the-art machine learning models, viz., a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), and three other CNN based deep learning (DL) models such as VGG-16, ResNet-50 and Inception-v3 in classifying CT images into three classes, viz., normal, non-covid pneumonia, and COVID-19 is carried out on these two datasets. Our analysis showed that the performance of all the models is comparable on the hold-out COVIDx CT 2A test set with 90% - 99% accuracies (96% for CNN), while on the external Indian-COVID-19 CT dataset a drop in the performance is observed for all the models (8% - 19%).

Both model-based distortion (noise, compression) and motion-based distortion (binding error, motion unnaturalness) are taken into consideration. Ten types of common motion are employed to drive the DDHs and a total of 800 DDHs are generated in the end. Afterward, we render the video sequences of the distorted DDHs as the evaluation media and carry out a well-controlled subjective experiment.

{"title":"xFBD: Focused Building Damage Dataset and Analysis","description":"The xView2 competition and xBD dataset spurred significant advancements in overhead building damage detection, but the competition's pixel level scoring can lead to reduced solution performance in areas with tight clusters of buildings or uninformative context. We seek to advance automatic building damage assessment for disaster relief by proposing an auxiliary challenge to the original xView2 competition. This new challenge involves a new dataset and metrics indicating solution performance when damage is more local and limited than in xBD. Our challenge measures a network's ability to identify individual buildings and their damage level without excessive reliance on the buildings' surroundings. Methods that succeed on this challenge will provide more fine-grained, precise damage information than original xView2 solutions. The best-performing xView2 networks' performances dropped noticeably in our new limited/local damage detection task. The common causes of failure observed are that (1) building objects and their classifications are not separated well, and (2) when they are, the classification is strongly biased by surrounding buildings and other damage context. Thus, we release our augmented version of the dataset with additional object-level scoring metrics https://gitlab.kitware.com/dennis.melamed/xfbd to test independence and separability of building objects, alongside the pixel-level performance metrics of the original competition.

The abundance and oftentimes imperceptible inter-dependencies of configuration settings make it difficult to optimize and performance-tune a NoSQL system. There is no one-size-fits-all configuration and therefore the workload, the physical design, and available resources need to be taken into account when optimizing the configuration of a NoSQL database.

{"title":"Quirk or Palmer: A Comparative Study of Modal Verb Frameworks with Annotated Datasets","description":"Modal verbs, such as \"can\", \"may\", and \"must\", are commonly used in daily communication to convey the speaker's perspective related to the likelihood and/or mode of the proposition. They can differ greatly in meaning depending on how they're used and the context of a sentence (e.g. \"They 'must' help each other out.\" vs. \"They 'must' have helped each other out.\") Despite their practical importance in natural language understanding, linguists have yet to agree on a single, prominent framework for the categorization of modal verb senses. This lack of agreement stems from high degrees of flexibility and polysemy from the modal verbs, making it more difficult for researchers to incorporate insights from this family of words into their work. This work presents Moverb dataset, which consists of 27,240 annotations of modal verb senses over 4,540 utterances containing one or more sentences from social conversations. Each utterance is annotated by three annotators using two different theoretical frameworks (i.e., Quirk and Palmer) of modal verb senses. We observe that both frameworks have similar inter-annotator agreements, despite having different numbers of sense types (8 for Quirk and 3 for Palmer). With the RoBERTa-based classifiers fine-tuned on \\dataset, we achieve F1 scores of 82.2 and 78.3 on Quirk and Palmer, respectively, showing that modal verb sense disambiguation is not a trivial task.

{"title":"Wide-scale Monitoring of Satellite Lifetimes: Pitfalls and a Benchmark Dataset","description":"An important task within the broader goal of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is to observe changes in the orbits of satellites, where the data spans thousands of objects over long time scales (decades). The Two-Line Element (TLE) data provided by the North American Aerospace Defense Command is the most comprehensive and widely-available dataset cataloguing the orbits of satellites. This makes it a highly-attractive data source on which to perform this observation. However, when attempting to infer changes in satellite behaviour from TLE data, there are a number of potential pitfalls. These mostly relate to specific features of the TLE data which are not always clearly documented in the data sources or popular software packages for manipulating them. These quirks produce a particularly hazardous data type for researchers from adjacent disciplines (such as anomaly detection or machine learning). We highlight these features of TLE data and the resulting pitfalls in order to save future researchers from being trapped.

The Two-Line Element (TLE) data provided by the North American Aerospace Defense Command is the most comprehensive and widely-available dataset cataloguing the orbits of satellites. This makes it a highly-attractive data source on which to perform this observation. However, when attempting to infer changes in satellite behaviour from TLE data, there are a number of potential pitfalls. These mostly relate to specific features of the TLE data which are not always clearly documented in the data sources or popular software packages for manipulating them. These quirks produce a particularly hazardous data type for researchers from adjacent disciplines (such as anomaly detection or machine learning). We highlight these features of TLE data and the resulting pitfalls in order to save future researchers from being trapped.

{"title":"Enhanced Sharp-GAN For Histopathology Image Synthesis","description":"Histopathology image synthesis aims to address the data shortage issue in training deep learning approaches for accurate cancer detection. However, existing methods struggle to produce realistic images that have accurate nuclei boundaries and less artifacts, which limits the application in downstream tasks. To address the challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances the quality of synthetic images by using nuclei topology and contour regularization. The proposed approach uses the skeleton map of nuclei to integrate nuclei topology and separate touching nuclei. In the loss function, we propose two new contour regularization terms that enhance the contrast between contour and non-contour pixels and increase the similarity between contour pixels. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets using image quality metrics and a downstream task (nuclei segmentation). The proposed approach outperforms Sharp-GAN in all four image quality metrics on two datasets.

{"title":"An Asynchronous Intensity Representation for Framed and Event Video Sources","description":"Neuromorphic \"event\" cameras, designed to mimic the human vision system with asynchronous sensing, unlock a new realm of high-speed and high dynamic range applications. However, researchers often either revert to a framed representation of event data for applications, or build bespoke applications for a particular camera's event data type. To usher in the next era of video systems, accommodate new event camera designs, and explore the benefits to asynchronous video in classical applications, we argue that there is a need for an asynchronous, source-agnostic video representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel, asynchronous intensity representation for both framed and non-framed data sources. We show that our representation can increase intensity precision and greatly reduce the number of samples per pixel compared to grid-based representations.

However, researchers often either revert to a framed representation of event data for applications, or build bespoke applications for a particular camera's event data type. To usher in the next era of video systems, accommodate new event camera designs, and explore the benefits to asynchronous video in classical applications, we argue that there is a need for an asynchronous, source-agnostic video representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel, asynchronous intensity representation for both framed and non-framed data sources. We show that our representation can increase intensity precision and greatly reduce the number of samples per pixel compared to grid-based representations.

{"title":"Characterising fast-time variations in the hard X-ray time profiles of solar flares using Solar Orbiter's STIX","description":"Aims: The aim of this work is to develop a method to systematically detect and characterise fast-time variations ($\\gtrsim 1$s) in the non-thermal hard X-ray (HXR) time profiles of solar flares using high-resolution data from Solar Orbiter's Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX).   Methods: The HXR time profiles were smoothed using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. The time profiles were then fitted with a linear combination of Gaussians to decompose the time profile. From the Gaussian decomposition, key characteristics such as the periodicity, full width at half maximum (FWHM), time evolution, and amplitude can be derived.   Results: We present the outcome of applying this method to four M and X GOES-class flares from the first year of Solar Orbiter science operations. The HXR time profiles of these flares were decomposed into individual Gaussians and their periods were derived. The quality of fit is quantified by the standard deviation of the residuals (difference between observed and fitted curve, normalised by the error on the observed data), for which we obtain $\\leq 1.8$ for all flares presented. In this work, the first detection of fast-time variations with Solar Orbiter's STIX instrument has been made on timescales across the range of 4-128s.   Conclusions: A new method for identifying and characterising fast-time variations in the non-thermal HXR profiles of solar flares has been developed, in which the time profiles are fit with a linear combination of Gaussian bursts.

{"title":"Cross-domain Unsupervised Reconstruction with Equivariance for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography","description":"Accurate image reconstruction is crucial for photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT). Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA image with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground truth labels. In practice, there are inevitable trade-offs between cost and performance since the use of more channels is an expensive strategy to access more measurements. Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction (CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of ground truth labels from limited PA measurements. The proposed approach exploits the equivariance of PACT to achieve high performance with a smaller number of channels. We implement a self-supervised reconstruction in a model-based form. Meanwhile, we also leverage the self-supervision to enforce the measurement and image consistency on three partitions of measured PA data, by randomly masking different channels. We find that dynamically masking a high proportion of the channels, e.g., 80%, yields nontrivial self-supervisors in both image and signal domains, which decrease the multiplicity of the pseudo solution to efficiently reconstruct the image from fewer PA measurements with minimum error of the image. Experimental results on in-vivo PACT dataset of mice demonstrate the potential of our unsupervised framework. In addition, our method shows a high performance (0.83 structural similarity index (SSIM) in the extreme sparse case with 13 channels), which is close to that of supervised scheme (0.77 SSIM with 16 channels).

First, to address the spatial variance problem, LitAR uses two-field lighting reconstruction to divide the lighting reconstruction task into the spatial variance-aware near-field reconstruction and the directional-aware far-field reconstruction. The corresponding environment map allows reflective rendering with correct color tones. Second, LitAR uses two noise-tolerant data capturing policies to ensure data quality, namely guided bootstrapped movement and motion-based automatic capturing.

{"title":"Understanding Concept Identification as Consistent Data Clustering Across Multiple Feature Spaces","description":"Identifying meaningful concepts in large data sets can provide valuable insights into engineering design problems. Concept identification aims at identifying non-overlapping groups of design instances that are similar in a joint space of all features, but which are also similar when considering only subsets of features. These subsets usually comprise features that characterize a design with respect to one specific context, for example, constructive design parameters, performance values, or operation modes. It is desirable to evaluate the quality of design concepts by considering several of these feature subsets in isolation. In particular, meaningful concepts should not only identify dense, well separated groups of data instances, but also provide non-overlapping groups of data that persist when considering pre-defined feature subsets separately. In this work, we propose to view concept identification as a special form of clustering algorithm with a broad range of potential applications beyond engineering design. To illustrate the differences between concept identification and classical clustering algorithms, we apply a recently proposed concept identification algorithm to two synthetic data sets and show the differences in identified solutions. In addition, we introduce the mutual information measure as a metric to evaluate whether solutions return consistent clusters across relevant subsets. To support the novel understanding of concept identification, we consider a simulated data set from a decision-making problem in the energy management domain and show that the identified clusters are more interpretable with respect to relevant feature subsets than clusters found by common clustering algorithms and are thus more suitable to support a decision maker.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05525v1","created":"2023-01-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Understanding Concept Identification as Consistent Data Clustering Across Multiple Feature Spaces Identifying meaningful concepts in large data sets can provide valuable insights into engineering design problems.

{"title":"Adapting to Skew: Imputing Spatiotemporal Urban Data with 3D Partial Convolutions and Biased Masking","description":"We adapt image inpainting techniques to impute large, irregular missing regions in urban settings characterized by sparsity, variance in both space and time, and anomalous events. Missing regions in urban data can be caused by sensor or software failures, data quality issues, interference from weather events, incomplete data collection, or varying data use regulations; any missing data can render the entire dataset unusable for downstream applications. To ensure coverage and utility, we adapt computer vision techniques for image inpainting to operate on 3D histograms (2D space + 1D time) commonly used for data exchange in urban settings.   Adapting these techniques to the spatiotemporal setting requires handling skew: urban data tend to follow population density patterns (small dense regions surrounded by large sparse areas); these patterns can dominate the learning process and fool the model into ignoring local or transient effects. To combat skew, we 1) train simultaneously in space and time, and 2) focus attention on dense regions by biasing the masks used for training to the skew in the data. We evaluate the core model and these two extensions using the NYC taxi data and the NYC bikeshare data, simulating different conditions for missing data. We show that the core model is effective qualitatively and quantitatively, and that biased masking during training reduces error in a variety of scenarios. We also articulate a tradeoff in varying the number of timesteps per training sample: too few timesteps and the model ignores transient events; too many timesteps and the model is slow to train with limited performance gain.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04233v1","created":"2023-01-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Adapting to Skew: Imputing Spatiotemporal Urban Data with 3D Partial Convolutions and Biased Masking We adapt image inpainting techniques to impute large, irregular missing regions in urban settings characterized by sparsity, variance in both space and time, and anomalous events.

In a 'plain' VVC approach, concepts from picture-to-picture temporal prediction are employed for decorrelation along the MSI's spectral dimension. The popular principle component analysis (PCA) for spectral decorrelation is further evaluated in combination with VVC intra-coding for spatial decorrelation. This approach is referred to as PCA-VVC. A novel adaptive MSI compression algorithm, named HPCLS, is introduced, that uses PCA and inter-prediction for spectral and VVC intra-coding for spatial decorrelation. Further, a novel adaptive scalable approach is proposed, that provides a separately decodable spectrally scaled preview of the MSI in the compressed file.

We find that NeRF-based models are significantly degraded in the presence of corruption, and are more sensitive to a different set of corruptions than image recognition models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the feature encoder in generalizable methods, which synthesize images using neural features extracted via convolutional neural networks or transformers, and find that it only contributes marginally to robustness.

Can data from LCS be used to identify hotspots and generate generalizable pollutant concentration maps? To help address these questions we deployed low-cost PM2.5 sensors (Alphasense OPC-N3) and a research-grade instrument (TSI DustTrak) in a mobile laboratory in Boston, MA, USA. We first collocated these instruments with stationary PM2.5 reference monitors at nearby regulatory sites. Next, using the reference measurements, we developed different models to correct the OPC-N3 and DustTrak measurements, and then transferred the corrections to the mobile setting. We observed that more complex correction models appeared to perform better than simpler models in the stationary setting; however, when transferred to the mobile setting, corrected OPC-N3 measurements agreed less well with corrected DustTrak data. In general, corrections developed using minute-level collocation measurements transferred better to the mobile setting than corrections developed using hourly-averaged data.

{"title":"FedDebug: Systematic Debugging for Federated Learning Applications","description":"In Federated Learning (FL), clients train a model locally and share it with a central aggregator to build a global model. Impermissibility to access client's data and collaborative training makes FL appealing for applications with data-privacy concerns such as medical imaging.

Developers resort to trial-and-error debugging with subsets of clients, hoping to increase the accuracy or let future FL rounds retune the model, which are time-consuming and costly.   We design a systematic fault localization framework, FedDebug, that advances the FL debugging on two novel fronts. First, FedDebug enables interactive debugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and replay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. FedDebug's {\\em breakpoint} can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model) and seamlessly move between rounds and clients' models, enabling a fine-grained step-by-step inspection. Second, FedDebug automatically identifies the client responsible for lowering global model's performance without any testing data and labels--both are essential for existing debugging techniques.

{"title":"Multiclass Semantic Segmentation to Identify Anatomical Sub-Regions of Brain and Measure Neuronal Health in Parkinson's Disease","description":"Automated segmentation of anatomical sub-regions with high precision has become a necessity to enable the quantification and characterization of cells/ tissues in histology images. Currently, a machine learning model to analyze sub-anatomical regions of the brain to analyze 2D histological images is not available. The scientists rely on manually segmenting anatomical sub-regions of the brain which is extremely time-consuming and prone to labeler-dependent bias. One of the major challenges in accomplishing such a task is the lack of high-quality annotated images that can be used to train a generic artificial intelligence model. In this study, we employed a UNet-based architecture, compared model performance with various combinations of encoders, image sizes, and sample selection techniques. Additionally, to increase the sample set we resorted to data augmentation which provided data diversity and robust learning. In this study, we trained our best fit model on approximately one thousand annotated 2D brain images stained with Nissl/ Haematoxylin and Tyrosine Hydroxylase enzyme (TH, indicator of dopaminergic neuron viability). The dataset comprises of different animal studies enabling the model to be trained on different datasets. The model effectively is able to detect two sub-regions compacta (SNCD) and reticulata (SNr) in all the images. In spite of limited training data, our best model achieves a mean intersection over union (IOU) of 79% and a mean dice coefficient of 87%.

{"title":"Cognitive Endurance, Talent Selection, and the Labor Market Returns to Human Capital","description":"Cognitive endurance -- the ability to sustain performance on a cognitively-demanding task over time -- is thought to be a crucial productivity determinant. However, a lack of data on this variable has limited researchers' ability to understand its role for success in college and the labor market. This paper uses college-admission-exam records from 15 million Brazilian high school students to measure cognitive endurance based on changes in performance throughout the exam. By exploiting exogenous variation in the order of exam questions, I show that students are 7.1 percentage points more likely to correctly answer a given question when it appears at the beginning of the day versus the end (relative to a sample mean of 34.3%). I develop a method to decompose test scores into fatigue-adjusted ability and cognitive endurance. I then merge these measures into a higher-education census and the earnings records of the universe of Brazilian formal-sector workers to quantify the association between endurance and long-run outcomes. I find that cognitive endurance has a statistically and economically significant wage return. Controlling for fatigue-adjusted ability and other student characteristics, a one-standard-deviation higher endurance predicts a 5.4% wage increase. This wage return to endurance is sizable, equivalent to a third of the wage return to ability. I also document positive associations between endurance and college attendance, college quality, college graduation, firm quality, and other outcomes. Finally, I show how systematic differences in endurance across students interact with the exam design to determine the sorting of students to colleges.

{"title":"Quantum relaxation for quadratic programs over orthogonal matrices","description":"Quadratic programming over the (special) orthogonal group encompasses a broad class of optimization problems such as group synchronization, point-set registration, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Such problems are instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a natural generalization of quadratic combinatorial optimization where, instead of binary decision variables, one optimizes over orthogonal matrices. In this work, we establish an embedding of this class of LNCG problems over the orthogonal group onto a quantum Hamiltonian. This embedding is accomplished by identifying orthogonal matrices with their double cover (Pin and Spin group) elements, which we represent as quantum states. We connect this construction to the theory of free fermions, which provides a physical interpretation of the derived LNCG Hamiltonian as a two-body interacting-fermion model due to the quadratic nature of the problem. Determining extremal states of this Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, analogous to classical relaxations of the problem via semidefinite programming. When optimizing over the special orthogonal group, our quantum relaxation naturally obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation matrices.

Such problems are instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a natural generalization of quadratic combinatorial optimization where, instead of binary decision variables, one optimizes over orthogonal matrices. In this work, we establish an embedding of this class of LNCG problems over the orthogonal group onto a quantum Hamiltonian. This embedding is accomplished by identifying orthogonal matrices with their double cover (Pin and Spin group) elements, which we represent as quantum states. We connect this construction to the theory of free fermions, which provides a physical interpretation of the derived LNCG Hamiltonian as a two-body interacting-fermion model due to the quadratic nature of the problem. Determining extremal states of this Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, analogous to classical relaxations of the problem via semidefinite programming. When optimizing over the special orthogonal group, our quantum relaxation naturally obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation matrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential in matrix dimension, whereas the quantum representation requires only a linear number of qubits.

{"title":"Credible Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Evidential Fusion on Aerial-Ground Dual-view Images","description":"Due to their ability to offer more comprehensive information than data from a single view, multi-view (multi-source, multi-modal, multi-perspective, etc.) data are being used more frequently in remote sensing tasks. However, as the number of views grows, the issue of data quality becomes more apparent, limiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural network (DNN) based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing them renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and inflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view. Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible.

However, as the number of views grows, the issue of data quality becomes more apparent, limiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural network (DNN) based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing them renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and inflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view. Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible. On two well-known, publicly available datasets of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing images, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness.

{"title":"ImageNet Advise","description":"I've gotten to the point in my PhD career to where I have some really good CNN model variants, on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and some other datasets (Flowers,Cars, Caltech). We wish to apply to NeurIPS this Spring, deadline around May 13. However, it seems that to have a chance at getting accepted at top conferences, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc, reviewers are looking at results on ImageNet2012.\n\nThe problem being, my university does not have a lot of resources available. Granted, we have 2 40GB A100 GPUs available, but these are shared within the entire university. From my estimate, using both A100 GPUs will allow us to use a batch size around 256 when testing our final model, containing 22 million parameters, at a max image size of 300.

Unfortunately, we have about 6 of these models (variants) to test (no way to cut it down). Equating to roughly 24 full days worth of computation on 2 A100 GPUS (which has about a 50/50% chance of finishing by May, given wait times in queue). We definitely don't have the computation to run each one 3 times to obtain a mean, so our results will be based off one training session.\n\nI know there are ImageNet derivative datasets, such as TinyImageNet (which scales all images to 64x64) or  ImageNet100 (which only contains 100 classes). I believe I can definitely obtain results for either of these datasets within the given time frame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion: For top conferences focused on CNNs and deep learning, are ImageNet results that influential?

However, what is quite annoying in make is that there seems to be no nice way of passing command line arguments to a script. Therefore, I am looking for an alternative. What tools do you use in your python project for similar usecases?","classes":{"dataset":0.4554300606,"prompteng":0.385306567}}

{"title":"Targeted Summarization - A tool for information extraction","description":"&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Visual of the Algorithm](https://reddit.com/link/10kys25/video/dci8r3ovz6ea1/player)\n\nHere's the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/helliun/targetedSummarization](https://github.com/helliun/targetedSummarization)\n\nTextReducer is a tool for summarization and information extraction powered by the SentenceTransformer library. Unlike many techniques for extractive summaries, TextReducer has the option for a \"target\" around which the summary will be focused. This target can be any text prompt, meaning that a user can specify the type of information that they would like to find or summarize, and ignore everything else.\n\nAnother key benefits of TextReducer is that rather than extracting the sentences for the summary, it carves away at the original text, removing unnecessary sentences. This leads to more fluent summarizations, and preserves grammatical features like coreference that are often lost in traditional extractive summarization.\n\nFor instance, in the sentences \"In his free time, John enjoyed playing golf and traveling with his family. He was married with two children, and lived in a suburban area with his wife and kids.\", it is imporant that these sentences stay linked together. Otherwise, the coreferent of the word \"He\" in the second sentence is lost. TextReducer is much better at preserving such related sentences, and is thus a valuable tool for fast, but fluent summarizations of large texts.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/10kys25/targeted_summarization_a_tool_for_information/","created":"2023-01-25","tags":["languagetechnology","reddit","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":2},"text":"Targeted Summarization - A tool for information extraction &amp;#x200B;\n\n[Visual of the Algorithm](https://reddit.com/link/10kys25/video/dci8r3ovz6ea1/player)\n\nHere's the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/helliun/targetedSummarization](https://github.com/helliun/targetedSummarization)\n\nTextReducer is a tool for summarization and information extraction powered by the SentenceTransformer library.

{"title":"The Random Hivemind: An Ensemble Deep Learner. A Case Study of Application to Solar Energetic Particle Prediction Problem","description":"Deep learning has become a popular trend in recent years in the machine learning community and has even occasionally become synonymous with machine learning itself thanks to its efficiency, malleability, and ability to operate free of human intervention. However, a series of hyperparameters passed to a conventional neural network (CoNN) may be rather arbitrary, especially if there is no surefire way to decide how to program hyperparameters for a given dataset. The random hivemind (RH) alleviates this concern by having multiple neural network estimators make decisions based on random permutations of features. The learning rate and the number of epochs may be boosted or attenuated depending on how all features of a given estimator determine the class that the numerical feature data belong to, but all other hyperparameters remain the same across estimators. This allows one to quickly see whether consistent decisions on a given dataset can be made by multiple neural networks with the same hyperparameters, with random subsets of data chosen to force variation in how data are predicted by each, placing the quality of the data and hyperparameters into focus.

While meshes can be generated from point clouds via techniques like Shape as Points (SAP), the challenges of directly generating meshes can be effectively avoided. To boost the efficiency and controllability of our mesh generation method, we propose to further encode point clouds to a set of sparse latent points with point-wise semantic meaningful features, where two DDPMs are trained in the space of sparse latent points to respectively model the distribution of the latent point positions and features at these latent points. We find that sampling in this latent space is faster than directly sampling dense point clouds.

In this work, we propose feature-rich audio model inversion (FRAMI), a data-free knowledge distillation framework for general sound classification tasks. It first generates high-quality and feature-rich Mel-spectrograms through a feature-invariant contrastive loss. Then, the hidden states before and after the statistics pooling layer are reused when knowledge distillation is performed on these feature-rich samples. Experimental results on the Urbansound8k, ESC-50, and audioMNIST datasets demonstrate that FRAMI can generate feature-rich samples.

In this work, we propose feature-rich audio model inversion (FRAMI), a data-free knowledge distillation framework for general sound classification tasks. It first generates high-quality and feature-rich Mel-spectrograms through a feature-invariant contrastive loss. Then, the hidden states before and after the statistics pooling layer are reused when knowledge distillation is performed on these feature-rich samples. Experimental results on the Urbansound8k, ESC-50, and audioMNIST datasets demonstrate that FRAMI can generate feature-rich samples. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the student model is further improved by reusing the hidden state and significantly outperforms the baseline method.","classes":{"dataset":0.0581799261,"prompteng":0.0019024586}}
{"title":"Tensor-based Multimodal Learning for Prediction of Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure from Cardiac MRI","description":"Heart failure is a serious and life-threatening condition that can lead to elevated pressure in the left ventricle. Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure (PAWP) is an important surrogate marker indicating high pressure in the left ventricle. PAWP is determined by Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) but it is an invasive procedure. A non-invasive method is useful in quickly identifying high-risk patients from a large population. In this work, we develop a tensor learning-based pipeline for identifying PAWP from multimodal cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This pipeline extracts spatial and temporal features from high-dimensional scans. For quality control, we incorporate an epistemic uncertainty-based binning strategy to identify poor-quality training samples. To improve the performance, we learn complementary information by integrating features from multimodal data: cardiac MRI with short-axis and four-chamber views, and Electronic Health Records. The experimental analysis on a large cohort of $1346$ subjects who underwent the RHC procedure for PAWP estimation indicates that the proposed pipeline has a diagnostic value and can produce promising performance with significant improvement over the baseline in clinical practice (i.e., $\\Delta$AUC $=0.10$, $\\Delta$Accuracy $=0.06$, and $\\Delta$MCC $=0.39$). The decision curve analysis further confirms the clinical utility of our method.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07540v1","created":"2023-03-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Tensor-based Multimodal Learning for Prediction of Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure from Cardiac MRI Heart failure is a serious and life-threatening condition that can lead to elevated pressure in the left ventricle.

So this leads to the question, why are so many devs hardcoding secrets? The problem is a little more complicated with git because often a secret is hardcoded and removed without the dev realizing that the secret persists in the git history. But still, this is a big issue in the Python community. \n\nManaging secrets can be really easy thanks to helpful Pypi packages like [Python Dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) which is my favorite for its simplicity and easy ability to manage secrets for multiple different environments like Dev and Prod.

{"title":"Efficient and Secure Federated Learning for Financial Applications","description":"The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customers' sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens the door to privacy leakage. This leakage risk makes financial companies face an enormous challenge in their cooperation. Federated learning is a machine learning setting that can protect data privacy, but the high communication cost is often the bottleneck of the federated systems, especially for large neural networks. Limiting the number and size of communications is necessary for the practical training of large neural structures. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention as a method to reduce communication cost, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure aggregation framework cannot directly use gradient sparsification. This article proposes two sparsification methods to reduce communication cost in federated learning. One is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model parameter update, which solves the problem of maintaining model accuracy after high ratio sparsity.

This leakage risk makes financial companies face an enormous challenge in their cooperation. Federated learning is a machine learning setting that can protect data privacy, but the high communication cost is often the bottleneck of the federated systems, especially for large neural networks. Limiting the number and size of communications is necessary for the practical training of large neural structures. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention as a method to reduce communication cost, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure aggregation framework cannot directly use gradient sparsification. This article proposes two sparsification methods to reduce communication cost in federated learning. One is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model parameter update, which solves the problem of maintaining model accuracy after high ratio sparsity. It can significantly reduce the cost of a single communication. The other is to apply the sparsification method to the secure aggregation framework. We sparse the encryption mask matrix to reduce the cost of communication while protecting privacy.

{"title":"SpiderMesh: Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation","description":"For semantic segmentation in urban scene understanding, RGB cameras alone often fail to capture a clear holistic topology, especially in challenging lighting conditions. Thermal signal is an informative additional channel that can bring to light the contour and fine-grained texture of blurred regions in low-quality RGB image. Aiming at RGB-T (thermal) segmentation, existing methods either use simple passive channel/spatial-wise fusion for cross-modal interaction, or rely on heavy labeling of ambiguous boundaries for fine-grained supervision. We propose a Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing (SpiderMesh) framework that: 1) proactively compensates inadequate contextual semantics in optically-impaired regions via a demand-guided target masking algorithm; 2) refines multimodal semantic features with recursive meshing to improve pixel-level semantic analysis performance. We further introduce an asymmetric data augmentation technique M-CutOut, and enable semi-supervised learning to fully utilize RGB-T labels only sparsely available in practical use.

{"title":"Mapping Urban Population Growth from Sentinel-2 MSI and Census Data Using Deep Learning: A Case Study in Kigali, Rwanda","description":"To better understand current trends of urban population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, high-quality spatiotemporal population estimates are necessary. While the joint use of remote sensing and deep learning has achieved promising results for population distribution estimation, most of the current work focuses on fine-scale spatial predictions derived from single date census, thereby neglecting temporal analyses. In this work, we focus on evaluating how deep learning change detection techniques can unravel temporal population dynamics at short intervals. Since Post-Classification Comparison (PCC) methods for change detection are known to propagate the error of the individual maps, we propose an end-to-end population growth mapping method. Specifically, a ResNet encoder, pretrained on a population mapping task with Sentinel-2 MSI data, was incorporated into a Siamese network. The Siamese network was trained at the census level to accurately predict population change. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in Kigali, Rwanda, for the time period 2016-2020, using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 data.

{"title":"Progressive Frame Patching for FoV-based Point Cloud Video Streaming","description":"Immersive multimedia applications, such as Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, have become more practical with advances in hardware and software for acquiring and rendering 3D media as well as 5G/6G wireless networks. Such applications require the delivery of volumetric video to users with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) movements. Point Cloud has become a popular volumetric video format due to its flexibility and simplicity. A dense point cloud consumes much higher bandwidth than a 2D/360 degree video frame. User Field of View (FoV) is more dynamic with 6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. A user's view quality of a 3D object is affected by points occlusion and distance, which are constantly changing with user and object movements. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive streaming predicts user FoV and only downloads the data falling in the predicted FoV, but it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which is significant when a long buffer is used for smoothed streaming. In this work, we propose a multi-round progressive refinement framework for point cloud-based volumetric video streaming. Instead of sequentially downloading frames, we simultaneously downloads/patches multiple frames falling into a sliding time-window, leveraging on the scalability of point-cloud coding. The rate allocation among all tiles of active frames are solved analytically using the heterogeneous tile utility functions calibrated by the predicted user FoV. Multi-frame patching takes advantage of the streaming smoothness resulted from long buffer and the FoV prediction accuracy at short buffer length. We evaluate our solution using simulations driven by real point cloud videos, bandwidth traces and 6-DoF FoV traces of real users. The experiments show that our solution is robust against bandwidth/FoV prediction errors, and can deliver high and smooth quality in the face of bandwidth variations and dynamic user movements.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08336v1","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Progressive Frame Patching for FoV-based Point Cloud Video Streaming Immersive multimedia applications, such as Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, have become more practical with advances in hardware and software for acquiring and rendering 3D media as well as 5G/6G wireless networks.

{"title":"Towards High-Quality and Efficient Video Super-Resolution via Spatial-Temporal Data Overfitting","description":"As deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in various fields of computer vision, leveraging the overfitting ability of the DNN to achieve video resolution upscaling has become a new trend in the modern video delivery system. By dividing videos into chunks and overfitting each chunk with a super-resolution model, the server encodes videos before transmitting them to the clients, thus achieving better video quality and transmission efficiency. However, a large number of chunks are expected to ensure good overfitting quality, which substantially increases the storage and consumes more bandwidth resources for data transmission. On the other hand, decreasing the number of chunks through training optimization techniques usually requires high model capacity, which significantly slows down execution speed. To reconcile such, we propose a novel method for high-quality and efficient video resolution upscaling tasks, which leverages the spatial-temporal information to accurately divide video into chunks, thus keeping the number of chunks as well as the model size to minimum. Additionally, we advance our method into a single overfitting model by a data-aware joint training technique, which further reduces the storage requirement with negligible quality drop. We deploy our models on an off-the-shelf mobile phone, and experimental results show that our method achieves real-time video super-resolution with high video quality.

{"title":"[D] Challenges for Keras as a Deep Learning Framework","description":" Hey, I've been using Keras for a while now and I think it's a great deep learning framework, but there are some challenges that prevent it from overtaking PyTorch.

I've had issues with memory leaks and race conditions that were hard to reproduce, and the customer service team didn't investigate the problem or work with me to track it down. They also sometimes ignore tickets or requests for documentation fixes, which can be frustrating.\n\nAnother issue is that the functional programming interface in Keras has some limitations. While it's good for people who think in a functional way, the graph system in TensorFlow isn't generalized or abstracted well.

Additionally, data sharing is key to fully realizing the potential of machine learning models by providing a rich and diverse collection of training data. However, the personally-identifying nature of retinal images, encompassing the unique vascular structure of each individual, often prevents this data from being shared openly. While prior works have explored image de-identification strategies based on synthetic averaging of images in other domains (e.g. facial images), existing techniques face difficulty in preserving both privacy and clinical utility in retinal images, as we demonstrate in our work.

Methods: We obtained new observations at 1.5 GHz using the VLA in the D configuration, with the purpose of detecting the radio shell of the putative remnant. In addition, we observed a single pointing at 6.0 GHz toward PSR J1913+1011 to look for a radio pulsar wind nebula. We also studied the properties of the surrounding interstellar medium using data of the 13CO, HI, and infrared emissions, obtained from public surveys. Results: We did not find evidence of a radio shell down to the sensitivity of the new image at 1.5 GHz. We detect faint diffuse emission around PSR J1913+1011 at 6.0 GHz, which could represent a radio pulsar wind nebula powered by the pulsar. We find dense ambient gas at 60 km/s, which shows a good spatial correspondence with the TeV emission only in the western and eastern directions. There is also dense gas near the center of HESS J1912+101, where the TeV emission is weak. Using infrared data, we identify an active star-forming region in the western part of the shell. Conclusions: Based on the poor spatial match between the ambient gas and the TeV emission (which shows a good correlation in the western and eastern directions and an anticorrelation in the other directions), we conclude that the hadronic mechanism alone does not give a satisfactory explanation of the gamma rays from HESS J1912+101. Additional contributions may come from leptonic processes in the shell of the supernova remnant, together with contributions from PSR J1913$+$1011 and its pulsar wind nebula and/or from the star-forming region.

{"title":"Evaluating Language Models for Knowledge Base Completion","description":"Structured knowledge bases (KBs) are a foundation of many intelligent applications, yet are notoriously incomplete. Language models (LMs) have recently been proposed for unsupervised knowledge base completion (KBC), yet, despite encouraging initial results, questions regarding their suitability remain open. Existing evaluations often fall short because they only evaluate on popular subjects, or sample already existing facts from KBs. In this work, we introduce a novel, more challenging benchmark dataset, and a methodology tailored for a realistic assessment of the KBC potential of LMs. For automated assessment, we curate a dataset called WD-KNOWN, which provides an unbiased random sample of Wikidata, containing over 3.9 million facts. In a second step, we perform a human evaluation on predictions that are not yet in the KB, as only this provides real insights into the added value over existing KBs. Our key finding is that biases in dataset conception of previous benchmarks lead to a systematic overestimate of LM performance for KBC. However, our results also reveal strong areas of LMs. We could, for example, perform a significant completion of Wikidata on the relations nativeLanguage, by a factor of ~21 (from 260k to 5.8M) at 82% precision, usedLanguage, by a factor of ~2.1 (from 2.1M to 6.6M) at 82% precision, and citizenOf by a factor of ~0.3 (from 4.2M to 5.3M) at 90% precision. Moreover, we find that LMs possess surprisingly strong generalization capabilities: even on relations where most facts were not directly observed in LM training, prediction quality can be high.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11082v1","created":"2023-03-20","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Evaluating Language Models for Knowledge Base Completion Structured knowledge bases (KBs) are a foundation of many intelligent applications, yet are notoriously incomplete.

{"title":"ContraNeRF: Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Synthetic-to-real Novel View Synthesis via Contrastive Learning","description":"Although many recent works have investigated generalizable NeRF-based novel view synthesis for unseen scenes, they seldom consider the synthetic-to-real generalization, which is desired in many practical applications. In this work, we first investigate the effects of synthetic data in synthetic-to-real novel view synthesis and surprisingly observe that models trained with synthetic data tend to produce sharper but less accurate volume densities. For pixels where the volume densities are correct, fine-grained details will be obtained. Otherwise, severe artifacts will be produced. To maintain the advantages of using synthetic data while avoiding its negative effects, we propose to introduce geometry-aware contrastive learning to learn multi-view consistent features with geometric constraints. Meanwhile, we adopt cross-view attention to further enhance the geometry perception of features by querying features across input views. Experiments demonstrate that under the synthetic-to-real setting, our method can render images with higher quality and better fine-grained details, outperforming existing generalizable novel view synthesis methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. When trained on real data, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11052v1","created":"2023-03-20","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"ContraNeRF: Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Synthetic-to-real Novel View Synthesis via Contrastive Learning Although many recent works have investigated generalizable NeRF-based novel view synthesis for unseen scenes, they seldom consider the synthetic-to-real generalization, which is desired in many practical applications.

{"title":"Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Non-Rigid 3D Shape Matching","description":"The matching of 3D shapes has been extensively studied for shapes represented as surface meshes, as well as for shapes represented as point clouds. While point clouds are a common representation of raw real-world 3D data (e.g. from laser scanners), meshes encode rich and expressive topological information, but their creation typically requires some form of (often manual) curation. In turn, methods that purely rely on point clouds are unable to meet the matching quality of mesh-based methods that utilise the additional topological structure. In this work we close this gap by introducing a self-supervised multimodal learning strategy that combines mesh-based functional map regularisation with a contrastive loss that couples mesh and point cloud data. Our shape matching approach allows to obtain intramodal correspondences for triangle meshes, complete point clouds, and partially observed point clouds, as well as correspondences across these data modalities. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets even in comparison to recent supervised methods, and that our method reaches previously unseen cross-dataset generalisation ability.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10971v1","created":"2023-03-20","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Non-Rigid 3D Shape Matching The matching of 3D shapes has been extensively studied for shapes represented as surface meshes, as well as for shapes represented as point clouds.

{"title":"[P] Make AI Robust and Trustworthy with CAPSA!","description":"Modern AI models show great potential across various applications, but their deployment in everyday life is limited due to a lack of trustworthiness. While accuracy is crucial, AI models must also recognize when they can and cannot be trusted to make decisions, especially in safety-critical systems. To bridge this gap, it\u2019s essential to develop AI models with built-in trust mechanisms for reliable decision-making in real-world scenarios.\n\nTrustworthiness in AI models can be improved by addressing three risk sources: Representation Bias, Epistemic Uncertainty, and Aleatoric Uncertainty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Representation Bias refers to the potential for the model to favor certain groups or types of data over others, leading to inaccuracies in its predictions with under-represented data.\n* Epistemic Uncertainty, also known as Model Uncertainty, describes the uncertainty associated with the model\u2019s ability to make accurate predictions based on the data it has been trained on. Epistemic uncertainty can be improved by training the model longer, or picking a model architecture with higher predictive capacity.\n* Aleatoric Uncertainty, also known as Data Uncertainty, refers to the inherent noise or unpredictability in the data itself. This type of uncertainty can arise due to factors such as measurement errors, labeling errors, or natural variations in the data. This can only be improved by improving the data source, or manually fixing the inherent issues that lie within the dataset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo address this issue of AI trust and gain knowledge of the risk metrics mentioned above, we are open-sourcing CAPSA -- a tool that automates the creation of robust and trustworthy neural networks! It is a Python library that utilizes wrappers to make tensorflow/keras models risk-aware. These wrappers work by augmenting a given model to support the risk metric the wrapper provides. The wrapped model gains risk awareness capabilities, outputting risk metrics mentioned above alongside its predictions. Since these wrapped models are simply augmented models, they can be further trained with Keras API.\n\n[How Representation Bias, Epistemic Uncertainty, and Aleatoric Uncertainty looks in regression and classification tasks with 2d and 1d datasets.

{"title":"SkinCon: A skin disease dataset densely annotated by domain experts for fine-grained model debugging and analysis","description":"For the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in high-risk settings, such as healthcare, methods that provide interpretability/explainability or allow fine-grained error analysis are critical. Many recent methods for interpretability/explainability and fine-grained error analysis use concepts, which are meta-labels that are semantically meaningful to humans. However, there are only a few datasets that include concept-level meta-labels and most of these meta-labels are relevant for natural images that do not require domain expertise. Densely annotated datasets in medicine focused on meta-labels that are relevant to a single disease such as melanoma. In dermatology, skin disease is described using an established clinical lexicon that allows clinicians to describe physical exam findings to one another. To provide a medical dataset densely annotated by domain experts with annotations useful across multiple disease processes, we developed SkinCon: a skin disease dataset densely annotated by dermatologists. SkinCon includes 3230 images from the Fitzpatrick 17k dataset densely annotated with 48 clinical concepts, 22 of which have at least 50 images representing the concept. The concepts used were chosen by two dermatologists considering the clinical descriptor terms used to describe skin lesions. Examples include \"plaque\", \"scale\", and \"erosion\". The same concepts were also used to label 656 skin disease images from the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset, providing an additional external dataset with diverse skin tone representations. We review the potential applications for the SkinCon dataset, such as probing models, concept-based explanations, and concept bottlenecks.

{"title":"Universal Soldier: Using Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Detecting Backdoor Attacks","description":"Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine learning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as adversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model may be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network parameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a clean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped with a pre-designed pattern called \"trigger\". Unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the trigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special type of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its similarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model than UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger. We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB) and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on 345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the injected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00747v1","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Universal Soldier: Using Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Detecting Backdoor Attacks Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine learning tasks.

{"title":"Ariadne Codegen: code generator for Python GraphQL clients","description":"Hey everyone!\n\nRecently we've released [Ariadne Codegen](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-codegen), a new tool for Python which generates GraphQL clients from `*.graphql` files with schema and queries. This project evolved from the utility tool that was created at work to speed up the process of writing services integrating with and extending the GraphQL API of [Saleor](https://graphql.com/saleor/saleor), our company's open source e-commerce package.\n\nTL;DR for the problem solved is that writing GraphQL client by hand is mostly writing a lot of boilerplate code and translating the GraphQL types to Python dataclasses or Pydantic's models. And every new query is basically previous query copied over with some bits changed. This process is great for automation.\n\nOur Codegen is fast to get started with. You configure it by adding dedicated `[ariadne-codegen]` section to your `pyproject.toml` file, which contains settings for codegen telling it where to find the GraphQL schema and operations. You then run the ariadne-codegen command which makes the Codegen parse those files and generate a Python package implementing the GraphQL client providing those operations as fully typed methods. GraphQL types are represented as Pydantic models and Enums are represented as Python enums.\n\nFor example, this GraphQL query:\n\n    mutation UserCreate($name: String!, $email: String!, $password: String!) {\n      userCreate(input: { name: $name, email: $email, password: $password }) {\n        token\n        user {\n          id\n        }\n        errors {\n          location\n          type\n          message\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nBecomes this method on generated client:\n\n    class Client(BaseClient):\n        def user_create(self, name: str, email: str, password: str) -&gt; UserCreate:\n            # Bunch of boilerplate code building query and variables dict,\n            # then sending it to the GraphQL client and handling the response\n            return UserCreate.parse_obj(data)\n\nYou can then either release generated package as a library for others to use, or keep it as a part of the project you are working at\n\nMultiple customization options are also provided, including option switch between async and sync client, inject custom Python code into generated classes or swap default HTTP client with custom one.\n\n**GitHub repository:** [mirumee/ariadne-codegen](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-codegen)\n\nThere's also full [release announcement on Ariadne blog](https://ariadnegraphql.org/blog/2023/02/02/ariadne-codegen) that tells the whole story\n\nThank you for reading all of this.

{"title":"[D] Global Optimum of K-Means Cost Function","description":"I've recently started reading up on classical ML and I got a question about K-Means.\n\nMore concretely, I am confused about the uniqueness of the global optimal solution of K-Means's cost function.\n\nLet's state the problem formally below, extracted from Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book, exercise 9.1.\n\nConsider the \ud835\udc3e-means algorithm discussed in Section 9.1. Show that as a consequence of there being a finite number of possible assignments for the set of discrete indicator variables \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58, and that for each such assignment there is a unique optimum for the \ud835\udf41\ud835\udc58, the K-means algorithm must converge after a finite number of iterations.\n\nI made an answer \\[here\\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/603327/question-on-the-proof-of-convergence-of-k-means](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/603327/question-on-the-proof-of-convergence-of-k-means)) detailing the proof of why it does converge in Lloyd's algorithm, but I think I still do not understand why Lloyd's do not converge to a global minimum, which mathematical theorem/understanding am I missing here?\n\nI think that optimizing both the assignments and the centroids of K-Means at the same time is non-convex and hence there are many local minimums, we can use brute force to search for the global minimum but of course it is exponential to the number of data points.
